## Research Gap: Newspaper Acquisition Procedure

**What we know:**
- Newspapers were completely free with coffee purchase
- Papers mounted in wicker holders with metal rods on wall racks
- Unlimited reading time and quantity allowed
- Stefan Zweig confirmed "unlimited number of newspapers and journals"

**What remains unclear:**
- Exact procedure for obtaining newspapers (self-service vs. waiter service)
- Different protocols for regular vs. occasional customers
- Variation by newspaper type (local vs. international)

**Available evidence:**
- Judge Reiter story suggests waiters brought papers to regular customers' tables
- Peter Altenberg mentions having papers "in front of" him casually
- Modern sources describe self-service from racks
- No definitive 1890s contemporary account found

**Research needed:**
- Period diaries/memoirs with operational details
- Contemporary travel guides (Baedeker, Murray) with coffeehouse etiquette
- Staff training manuals or operational guides
- Detailed ethnographic accounts of coffeehouse procedures
