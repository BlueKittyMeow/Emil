Alchemy was indeed a significant historical feature of Prague. Prague was genuinely one of Europe's most important centers for alchemical studies, particularly during the reign of Emperor Rudolf II (1576-1612). While your novel is set in the 1890s, this alchemical history would still be part of Prague's cultural legacy and physical environment.


Some historical facts about Prague's alchemical significance:

The Court of Rudolf II: Emperor Rudolf II transformed Prague into a center for occult studies, including alchemy. He invited numerous alchemists to his court, including Edward Kelley and John Dee.
Golden Lane (Zlatá ulička): This famous street in Prague Castle contained small houses where alchemists reportedly worked. By the 1890s, these would be historical sites rather than active workshops, but still part of the city's identity.
The Speculum Alchemiae: An alchemical laboratory discovered in Prague in 2002 that dates back to the 16th and 17th centuries, confirming the historical presence of working alchemists.
Continued Influence: Even after Rudolf's era, Prague maintained a reputation for mysticism and alchemical studies. The city's Jewish quarter, with its connections to the Golem legend, further enhanced this reputation for mystical knowledge.
Literary Presence: By the 1890s, Prague's alchemical past was appearing in literature and cultural references, including Gustav Meyrink's works (though his famous "The Golem" was published slightly later, in 1915).

For your novel set in 1890s Prague, this alchemical history provides a perfect historical backdrop that creates tension between emerging modern medicine and older traditions of transformation and preservation. The city's history of attempting to transform base metals into gold creates a  parallel to the characters' attempts to transform (or preserve) human bodies through science.
