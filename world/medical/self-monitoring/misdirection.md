# Concealment Techniques

## Weight Loss Concealment
- Worn under multiple layers of clothing
- Choosing dark colors and heavy fabrics
- Scholarly robes during lectures would hide body shape
- Custom-tailored clothing to mask thinness

## Physical Symptom Management
- Trembling hands - might claim "nervous temperament" or excessive caffeine
- Cold intolerance - explained as poor circulation
- Fatigue - attributed to research demands or insomnia
- Dizziness/fainting - positioned as low blood pressure, a common diagnosis then

## Eating Behavior Disguise
- Claiming digestive sensitivities to explain restricted diet
- Scheduling lectures during meal times
- Consuming liquids publicly (broths, tea) which appear as sustenance
- Using research as excuse to avoid communal meals

## Medical Setting Advantages
- Could claim to be following scientific nutrition regimens (vegetarianism, food combining theories)
- Might reference studying his own metabolism for research purposes
- Could attribute weight changes to researching effects of fasting on brain function (legitimate research area then)
- Medical knowledge would let him anticipate and manage symptoms before they became visible

## Physical Examination Avoidance
- As a physician, unlikely to undergo routine examinations
- Would avoid situations requiring disrobing (swimming, medical consultations)
- Could fabricate physical examination records if required

## Historical Context
The fact that male anorexia was barely recognized would indeed work in his favor - colleagues might notice concerning symptoms but lack a conceptual framework to understand them cohesively as an eating disorder. They would more likely attribute his condition to:
- Overwork
- Nervous constitution
- Possibly tuberculosis (still common and associated with weight loss)
