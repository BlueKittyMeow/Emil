# Concealment Techniques

## Weight Loss Concealment
- Worn under multiple layers of clothing
- Choosing dark colors and heavy fabrics
- Scholarly robes during lectures would hide body shape
- Custom-tailored clothing to mask thinness

## Physical Symptom Management
- Trembling hands - might claim "nervous temperament" or excessive caffeine
- Cold intolerance - explained as poor circulation
- Fatigue - attributed to research demands or insomnia
- Dizziness/fainting - positioned as low blood pressure, a common diagnosis then

## Eating Behavior Disguise
- Claiming digestive sensitivities to explain restricted diet
- Scheduling lectures during meal times
- Consuming liquids publicly (broths, tea) which appear as sustenance
- Using research as excuse to avoid communal meals

## Medical Setting Advantages
- Could claim to be following scientific nutrition regimens (vegetarianism, food combining theories)
- Might reference studying his own metabolism for research purposes
- Could attribute weight changes to researching effects of fasting on brain function (legitimate research area then)
- Medical knowledge would let him anticipate and manage symptoms before they became visible

## Physical Examination Avoidance
- As a physician, unlikely to undergo routine examinations
- Would avoid situations requiring disrobing (swimming, medical consultations)
- Could fabricate physical examination records if required

## Historical Context
The fact that male anorexia was barely recognized would indeed work in his favor - colleagues might notice concerning symptoms but lack a conceptual framework to understand them cohesively as an eating disorder. They would more likely attribute his condition to:
- Overwork
- Nervous constitution
- Possibly tuberculosis (still common and associated with weight loss) 


More credible explanations Emil might use:

"Gastric catarrh" (common diagnosis for digestive issues)
Following specific dietary treatments popular at the time (like Kellogg's or Salisbury regimens)
Medical necessity due to "digestive weakness"
These would be more accepted than philosophical vegetarianism



Self-Experimentation Context
Self-experimentation had an interesting status in 1890s medicine:

Medical tradition of self-experimentation:

Respected scientific practice with notable examples (Koch, Jenner, etc.)
Some eminent physicians deliberately infected themselves or tested treatments on themselves
Viewed as demonstrating scientific dedication


Metabolism self-experiments specifically:

Would be more acceptable if framed as time-limited
Needs scientific purpose and documentation
Should lead to publications or teaching insights


Institutional reaction to self-experimentation:

Temporary, well-documented self-experimentation with clear scientific goals = potentially respected
Chronic self-starvation presented as perpetual "research" = concerning and potentially embarrassing
The key difference: purposeful, temporary experiments vs. pathological behavior disguised as research


Academic perception:

Colleagues might initially respect his "dedication to science"
Would become concerned if experiments continued indefinitely with no published results
Would question his judgment if physical deterioration became pronounced



So if Emil positioned his behavior as formal, time-limited self-experimentation with clear research goals, it would buy him time and credibility. However, this cover story would become less convincing over time if he produced no research outcomes and his condition worsened.

Managing Perceptions
Tailoring and Appearance:
With exceptionally good tailoring, Emil could potentially maintain a professional appearance down to a BMI of around 16-17 if he:

Used padded clothing with structured shoulders
Wore vests and multiple layers
Selected darker colors and heavier fabrics
Maintained good posture and deliberate movements
Focused on managing the appearance of his face and hands (most visible parts)

"Drawn" Appearance Explanation:

A drawn face could indeed be attributed to overwork or chronic minor illness
Colleagues would accept this explanation more readily if:

Emil maintained intellectual sharpness
He referenced specific, credible health issues (gastric catarrh, nervous dyspepsia)
He appeared to be "managing" his condition with appropriate treatments
He showed occasional, visible attempts to "improve" his health



Digestive Weakness as Cover:
Yes, "digestive weakness" or "gastric sensitivity" would be interpreted primarily as:

A painful but non-life-threatening condition
A legitimate reason for dietary restrictions
Something requiring specific food selections to minimize discomfort
A chronic but manageable condition common among intellectuals
NOT primarily associated with intentional weight loss or wellness diet

This would be much more socially and professionally acceptable than any philosophical or experimental dietary restriction.
The "Temporary Experiment" Strategy
Your suggested approach is quite brilliant and psychologically credible:

Position initial weight loss as temporary self-experimentation
Lose weight rapidly during this "official" experiment period
Claim to have concluded the experiment
Express frustration at inability to fully regain weight
Continue restricted eating privately while maintaining the narrative of attempted recovery

This approach would:

Initially gain scientific respect (temporary dedication to knowledge)
Provide an explanation for significant weight loss
Create a plausible excuse for ongoing thinness
Allow continued restriction while appearing to be trying to recover
Give him a fallback explanation if confronted ("I've been trying to regain weight")

This strategy could potentially allow Emil to maintain a BMI as low as 16-17 without triggering institutional intervention, provided he managed other symptoms carefully and maintained professional competence.
It would create a perfect psychological cover that leverages both medical knowledge and academic respect for self-experimentation, while exploiting the limited understanding of eating disorders in males during this period.
