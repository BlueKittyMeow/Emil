## Tolerability of Various BMI Levels
For a physician in 1890s Prague, with careful management of appearance:

### BMI 17-18 (53-56 kg / 116-123 lbs / 95-100 Pfund)
- Noticeably thin but potentially manageable with proper tailoring
- Would draw some concern but could be explained away as "constitutional thinness"
- Face would appear drawn but could be attributed to overwork
- Would need to avoid physical activities or situations requiring undressing

### BMI 16-17 (50-53 kg / 110-116 lbs / 89-95 Pfund)
- Quite thin, difficult to disguise completely
- Could potentially maintain professional standing if:
  - Excellent tailoring (padded shoulders, layered clothing)
  - Maintaining color in face (perhaps using subtle cosmetics)
  - Demonstrating mental sharpness and physical stamina during lectures
- Colleagues would definitely notice and express concern
- Would require consistent cover story and management of symptoms

### BMI 15-16 (46-50 kg / 101-110 lbs / 82-89 Pfund)
- Extremely thin, very difficult to disguise
- Likely to cause significant concern among colleagues
- Would require exceptional measures to maintain professional appearances
- Physical symptoms (cold intolerance, fatigue) would be difficult to hide
- At this point, intervention by colleagues becomes increasingly likely

### BMI Below 15 (under 46 kg / under 101 lbs / under 82 Pfund)
- Professional functioning would be severely compromised
- Physical appearance would be impossible to disguise effectively
- Intervention almost certain
