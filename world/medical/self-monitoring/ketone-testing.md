# Ketone Testing

## Methods Available in 1890s

### Gerhardt's Ferric Chloride Test (1865)
- Turns purple-red with ketones

### Legal's Sodium Nitroprusside Test (1882)
- Produces a burgundy color with ketones

## Self-Testing

- As an academically-positioned physician with chemical expertise, Emil could easily perform these tests himself
- Would require small amounts of urine and basic chemical reagents
- Could be conducted discreetly in his research laboratory
- No need for colleague involvement
- He could disguise this as research related to anesthesia metabolism

## Ketone Testing Cover Story

### Professional Explanation
"I'm investigating potential metabolic byproducts that might interfere with chloroform metabolism during prolonged surgeries. Patients in extended fasting states before surgery often develop ketonuria, and I'm studying whether these compounds might alter anesthetic requirements or post-surgical recovery."

### Scientific Credibility Elements
- A legitimate scientific question
- Connects to his specialty (anesthesia)
- Explains why he's measuring ketones
- Would appear academically credible to colleagues
