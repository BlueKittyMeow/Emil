# Understanding of Calories in the 1890s

## Scientific Developments
The 1890s marked a critical decade in understanding calories and food energy. During this period, it was established that a gram of carbohydrate or protein provided 4 calories of energy, while a gram of fat provided 9 calories - values that remain standard for measuring food energy today.

## Historical Timeline

### Early Origins
- Term "calorie" originated in early 19th century heat and physics studies
- Nicolas Cl√©ment introduced the concept in Paris (1819-1824) during lectures on heat engines

### Introduction to Food Science
- 1887: Wilbur O. Atwater popularizes the "Calorie" (modern kcal) in Century magazine
- 1894: Atwater publishes further calorie research in Farmers' Bulletin 23
- 1894: Raymond discusses kcal in relation to human energy needs in medical physiology texts

### Scientific Breakthroughs
- Atwater and Edward Bennett Rosa develop respiration calorimeter
- Measure human heat and carbon dioxide output under various conditions:
  - Sleep states
  - Study/mental activity
  - Physical activities (including vigorous cycling)
- March 1896: First public demonstration at Wesleyan University
  - Graduate student sealed in airtight chamber
  - Metabolism measured during controlled food consumption

### Formal Recognition
- 1896: Small calorie (cal) recognized as unit of CGS system
- Establishment of standardized measurements for food energy
- Integration into medical and scientific practice

## Impact on Medical Practice
- Introduction of quantifiable energy measurements
- Development of metabolic understanding
- Standardization of dietary calculations
- Integration into medical education
- Application in patient care and research
