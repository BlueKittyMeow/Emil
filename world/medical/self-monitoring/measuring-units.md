# Weight Measurements and Calorie Tracking

## Weight Conversion
- 1 Austrian Pfund = 0.56 kilograms
- If Emil weighed 70 kg, this would be approximately 125 Pfund

1 Austrian Pfund = 0.56 kilograms = 1.23 pounds
For example:

70 kg = 125 Pfund = 154 pounds
60 kg = 107 Pfund = 132 pounds
50 kg = 89 Pfund = 110 pounds


## Measurement Choice
- Professionally and scientifically, Emil would use kilograms
- He might think in Pfund for personal reference if he grew up with that system
- His medical records would exclusively use kilograms

## Calorie Type and Terminology
- Emil would track what we now call kilocalories (kcal)
- He would call these simply "Calories" (with capital C) or "heat units"
- This is the same unit used in today's 2000 calorie recommendation
- In German, he might use "WÃ¤rmeeinheiten" (heat units) or adopt "Kalorien"
