## Standard Medical Protocol
### Measurement Conditions
- Patient must be seated
- Required rest period: 5-10 minutes minimum
- Environment should be quiet and temperate
- Patient should avoid stimulants before measurement

### Measurement Technique
- Standard duration: 30 seconds Ã— 2

  - Above 80: Possible fever/anxiety/exertion
  - Below 60: Possible weakness/malnutrition
  - Irregular rhythm: Requires further investigation

### Professional Documentation
- Time of day
- Patient's position
- Duration of rest period
- Full minute count vs. 30-second calculation
- Notable deviations from baseline
- Associated symptoms or conditions

## Emil's Personal Protocol
### Self-Monitoring Practice
- Measures pulse each morning before rising
- Additional measurements after physical strain
- Documents variations from his baseline
- Notes correlation with other symptoms

### Documentation Method
- Personal notebook entries
- Time-stamped measurements
- Cross-referenced with:
  - Physical activity
  - Nutrition intake
  - Sleep patterns
  - Professional duties

### Clinical Significance
- Professional understanding of implications
- Self-monitoring as control mechanism
- Medical knowledge affecting interpretation
- Documentation serving dual purpose:
  - Personal health tracking
  - Professional observation
