## The Granville Mummy Case (1825)

### Overview
In 1825, Dr. Augustus Bozzi Granville performed what is considered the first modern scientific autopsy of an Egyptian mummy. The subject was a woman named Irtyersenu, estimated to be approximately 2,600 years old, who had been brought from the necropolis in Thebes.

### The Candle Incident
During his six-week examination, Dr. Granville made an unusual discovery that led to a macabre situation: he used what he believed to be "a mixture of bitumen and beeswax used to preserve her" to create candles that illuminated his presentation at the Royal Society. In reality, the substance was adipocere (also known as "corpse wax"), formed from the mummy's own decomposed body fat through a process called saponification.

### Scientific Details
- **Adipocere Formation**: This crumbly, waxy, water-insoluble material consists mostly of saturated fatty acids
- **Formation Conditions**: Requires high moisture and absence of oxygen
- **Timeline**: Begins forming within a month of death
- **Preservation**: Can persist for centuries without air exposure

### Historical Context
Dr. Augustus Bozzi Granville:
- Born in Milan in 1783
- Pioneer obstetrician and surgeon
- Studied at the University of Pavia
- Traveled extensively through Europe and the Middle East
- Served as a British navy surgeon
- Became a Royal Society fellow in 1818

### Medical Findings
- **Original Diagnosis**: Granville concluded Irtyersenu died from an ovarian tumor
- **Modern Analysis**: Recent scientific examination revealed the tumor was benign
- **Actual Cause of Death**: Likely tuberculosis

## Related Historical Cases

### Holy Innocents' Cemetery (Paris, 1786)
- Cemetery closure led to discovery of mass adipocere deposits
- Mass burial pits contained approximately 1,500 people each
- Accumulated adipocere was used in candles and soap production

### Mummy Brown Paint
- Artistic pigment made from ground Egyptian mummies
- Used by artists until the early 20th century
- Production ceased when mummy supplies became scarce

## Historical Significance
These cases highlight the sometimes ethically questionable practices in early scientific exploration and medical research. They demonstrate how limitations in scientific knowledge could lead to misinterpretations, even among learned scientists of the time. The cases also reflect changing attitudes toward human remains and scientific ethics over time.
