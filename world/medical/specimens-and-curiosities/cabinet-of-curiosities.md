# Cabinet of Curiosities: Medical Oddities and Historical Artifacts

## Medical Specimens

1. **Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) skeleton** - The most famous example is Harry Eastlack's skeleton at the Mütter Museum, showing the progression of muscles, tendons, and connective tissues gradually turning to bone.

2. **Specimens preserved in "spirit jars"** - Organs, fetuses, and anatomical abnormalities preserved in alcohol or formaldehyde:
   - Conjoined twins specimens
   - Hydrocephalic brains
   - Unusual tumors (like teratomas containing hair and teeth)
   - "Cyclops" fetuses with holoprosencephaly

3. **Medical wax models (moulages)** - Incredibly detailed anatomical models showing diseases:
   - Syphilis progression models
   - Smallpox and plague symptoms
   - Cross-sections of diseased organs

4. **Historical prosthetics** - Wooden limbs, glass eyes, and early facial prosthetics for war veterans

## Adjacent Curiosities

1. **Medical materials derived from human remains:**
   - Skull cups or bowls (used historically in Tibetan rituals but collected by Victorian explorers)
   - Human-tooth jewelry (Victorian mourning jewelry often incorporated teeth)
   - Human-skin book bindings (anthropodermic bibliopegy was practiced into the early 20th century)
   - Hair art and jewelry (incredibly intricate Victorian mourning art made from the deceased's hair)

2. **Execution artifacts:**
   - Hangman's ropes with provenance
   - Phrenological studies of executed criminals' skulls
   - Death masks of famous criminals or executed persons

3. **Trepanned skulls** - Ancient and medieval skulls showing evidence of crude brain surgery

4. **Memento mori artwork** - Sculptures, paintings or photographs incorporating human remains

## Scientific and Pseudoscientific Items

1. **Phrenology heads** - Porcelain models showing the supposed "brain regions" controlling personality
   
2. **Medical tools:**
   - Amputation kits
   - Bloodletting equipment
   - Trepanation tools
   - Early electroshock therapy devices

3. **Specimen collection kits** - The tools used to collect and preserve specimens, including specialized boxes, jars, and chemicals

4. **"Galvanized" specimens** - Preserved animals or human parts that were used in early electrical experiments to make muscles twitch

## Natural History with a Dark Twist

1. **Bog bodies or body parts** - Naturally preserved human remains from bog environments

2. **Chimeras and oddities:**
   - Taxidermy "mermaids" (sewn together fish and monkey parts)
   - Two-headed animals preserved through taxidermy
   - Malformed animal specimens

3. **Fossilized or preserved coprolites** - Historically collected during the Victorian era

4. **Unusual mineral specimens with supposed medicinal properties** - Many toxic minerals like arsenic and mercury compounds were used medicinally

5. **Preserved parasites** - Particularly large tapeworms or unusual parasites removed from patients

## Documentation and Context

1. **Medical journals with case studies** - Especially those with hand-drawn illustrations of unusual cases

2. **Photographs of medical oddities** - Early medical photography often documented unusual conditions

3. **Field notes and acquisition ledgers** - Documenting how specimens were obtained, often through questionable means

4. **"Scientific" correspondence** - Letters between collectors discussing their specimens and acquisition methods

## Historical Context for 1890s Prague

### Galvanism and Scientific Climate
- Galvanism experiments—using electricity to stimulate muscle movement in dead tissue—began with Luigi Galvani in the late 1700s and continued to captivate scientists and the public throughout the 1800s
- Prague was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire with prominent university medical faculties
- The 1890s marked Prague's scientific and cultural renaissance
- Jewish intellectual circles engaged with both scientific advancement and mystical traditions
- Specimens were preserved specifically for galvanic demonstrations
- The city's history of alchemy and the Golem legend created a unique backdrop for experimentation

### Medical Preservation Techniques
- Dry preservation methods
- Glass-enclosed displays with humidity control
- Early wax infiltration (precursor to plastination)
- Selective mummification
- Cross-sectional preservation techniques
- Chemical injection experiments

### Notable Medical Conditions
- Argyria (silver-induced skin discoloration)
  - Caused by colloidal silver and silver nitrate treatments
  - Used for epilepsy, stomach ailments, and syphilis
  - Also affected photographers due to silver exposure
- Preservation methods for displaying skin conditions
  - Controlled environment displays
  - Special preservation techniques to maintain coloration

The intersection of scientific advancement and human dignity creates natural tension in medical collections, particularly when considering the provenance of specimens and the ethical implications of their acquisition and display.
