PROJECT DESCRIPTION: PRAGUE MEDICAL GOTHIC NOVEL
Concept Overview
A literary gothic novel set in 1890s Prague that examines the ethical complexities of medical collection and preservation through the story of Emil, a young physician investigating mysterious specimen acquisitions while unknowingly becoming a potential specimen himself due to his own wasting condition.
Literary Approach
This work aspires to the depth and resonance of literary classics rather than genre fiction, drawing inspiration from:

The psychological complexity and human insight of Tolstoy
The atmospheric richness of Joyce's "The Dead"
The precision and symbolic depth of Eliot
The circular, myth-like qualities of García Márquez's "One Hundred Years of Solitude"

The novel will unfold with deliberate patience—"like a particularly old and battered umbrella under a storm that becomes a deluge—slowly, agonizingly too slowly, and then all at once." Target length is 150,000-200,000 words of spare, edited prose, with chapter structure and pacing reminiscent of 19th century novels.
Core Characters

Emil: Young physician with a wasting condition, investigating mysterious specimen acquisitions
Eduard: Emil's mentor, who gives philosophical monologues about medical history and serves as a potential red herring for the Protege's identity
The Protege: Mysterious figure continuing the Collector's work of acquiring specimens through questionable means
Klara: Paralyzed woman who sells her body to the Protege to provide for her mother's care
Helena: Klara's companion and possible lover
Felix: Architectural preservationist whose friendship with Emil creates thematic parallels between preserving buildings and bodies

Setting Elements

1890s Prague: A city at the intersection of ancient mysticism and emerging scientific modernity
Medical Institutions: Spaces where scientific advancement often conflicts with human dignity
Cabinet of Curiosities: Collection featuring:

Medical specimens (FOP skeletons, preserved organs, wax models)
Human remains repurposed as artifacts (adipocere candles, human-skin bindings, hair art)
Execution artifacts and death masks
Preserved "abnormalities" both human and animal
Documentation of acquisition methods



Key Themes

The ethics of medical collection and the commodification of human remains
The thin line between preservation and destruction
Bodily autonomy and consent in desperate circumstances
The limits of empirical observation in understanding human experience
The uncanny relationship between observer and observed
The preservation of buildings versus bodies
The tension between medical progress and human dignity

Narrative Structure

Integration of traditional prose with medical documentation (clinical notes, measurements)
Slow-building mystery regarding the Protege's identity
Emil's gradual transition from investigator to potential specimen
Structural parallels between architectural preservation and medical preservation

Distinctive Elements

Philosophical monologues (like Eduard's trepanation speech) that blend medical history with ethical questioning
Historically accurate medical practices and specimens
The ambiguity of consent in Klara's case, highlighting the exploitation inherent in many historical medical collections
Prague's unique atmosphere, combining scientific advancement with mystical alchemeic traditions

Literary Influences and Parallels

Tolstoy's character development and pacing
Joyce's atmospheric detail and psychological complexity
Victorian detection novels (Doyle, Collins) for mystery elements
García Márquez's mythic resonance
Gothic literary traditions reframed through medical science

This project aims not for the quick revelations of genre fiction but for the lasting resonance of great literary works—allowing space for digression, philosophical exploration, and the slow development of character and theme that elevates the specific narrative to touch on universal human experiences of mortality, ethics, desire, and preservation.
