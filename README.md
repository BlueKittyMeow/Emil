## Marketing Elements

### Elevator Pitch
In 1890s Prague, a brilliant but troubled medical researcher becomes entangled with a collector of medical curiosities, forcing him to confront the thin line between specimen and scientist—especially as his own self-experimentation threatens to transform him from observer to exhibit.

### Novel Blurb
In the gaslit laboratories of 1890s Prague, Dr. Emil Králik meticulously documents his own declining health while maintaining his prestigious position at the university. His research into anesthetics and pain management masks a deeper obsession: understanding his own inexplicable condition through rigorous self-experimentation.

When Emil encounters a mysterious collector of medical curiosities—whose specimens range from galvanized corpses to preserved medical oddities—he finds himself drawn into a world where the line between scientific observation and morbid spectacle blurs. As his self-experimentation intensifies and his body begins to betray him, Emil must confront an unsettling question: is he destined to become the collector's next acquisition?

Set against the backdrop of a city where alchemy mingles with emerging medical science, this gothic medical drama explores the lengths one man will go to understand his own mortality, and the price of turning oneself into a living specimen.

### Literary Analysis
This work delves deep into the philosophical tensions between observer and observed, the scientific gaze and human dignity, the measurable and the ineffable. Through its meticulous attention to historical detail and psychological complexity, the narrative weaves together themes of bodily autonomy, scientific objectification, and the human drive to understand through documentation.

The novel's structural innovation lies in its integration of medical documentation—Emil's own clinical notes, measurement records, and self-observations—with the more traditional narrative form. This documentary realism serves not merely as historical backdrop but as a meditation on the limits of empirical knowledge when confronted with the mysteries of human consciousness and suffering.

In its exploration of fin de siècle Prague, the work examines a crucial moment in medical history when the boundary between scientific progress and human dignity became increasingly contested. The city itself becomes a character, its ancient alchemical traditions and emerging medical institutions creating a landscape where the medieval and the modern collide.

The relationship between Emil and Felix, the architectural preservationist, provides a crucial counterpoint to the main narrative, contrasting the preservation of buildings with the preservation of bodies, and questioning what we choose to save and why. Their friendship explores the tension between those who document decay and those who attempt to prevent it.

Through its unflinching examination of self-starvation and bodily autonomy, the novel poses essential questions about the ownership of the body, the nature of scientific observation, and the fine line between research and obsession. The work's gothic elements serve not as mere aesthetic choice but as a philosophical framework for examining the uncanny relationship between the living and the dead, the observer and the observed, the scientist and the specimen.

## Project Focus
This project weaves together multiple threads: the ethical complexities of medical research, the tension between scientific progress and human dignity, and the gothic atmosphere of fin de siècle Prague. Through Emil's deteriorating condition and his relationship with medical specimens and curiosities, the story examines the commodification of human bodies in medical science, the obsessive nature of self-documentation, and the thin line between researcher and research subject. The narrative explores how the period's fascination with medical specimens and anatomical curiosities reflected broader cultural attitudes toward death, disease, and the human body.
