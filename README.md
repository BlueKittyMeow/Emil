## Marketing Elements

### Elevator Pitch
In 1890s Prague, a brilliant but troubled medical researcher becomes entangled with a collector of medical curiosities, forcing him to confront the thin line between specimen and scientist—especially as his own self-experimentation threatens to transform him from observer to exhibit.

### Novel Blurb
In the gaslit laboratories of 1890s Prague, Dr. Emil Králik meticulously documents his own declining health while maintaining his prestigious position at the university. His research into anesthetics and pain management masks a deeper obsession: understanding his own inexplicable condition through rigorous self-experimentation.

When Emil encounters a mysterious collector of medical curiosities—whose specimens range from galvanized corpses to preserved medical oddities—he finds himself drawn into a world where the line between scientific observation and morbid spectacle blurs. As his self-experimentation intensifies and his body begins to betray him, Emil must confront an unsettling question: is he destined to become the collector's next acquisition?

Set against the backdrop of a city where alchemy mingles with emerging medical science, this gothic medical drama explores the lengths one man will go to understand his own mortality, and the price of turning oneself into a living specimen.

### Literary Analysis
This work explores the tension between observer and observed, scientific objectification and human dignity, the measurable and the ineffable. Through meticulous historical detail and psychological depth, the narrative examines bodily autonomy, the scientific gaze, and our compulsion to document and preserve.
The novel's structural innovation lies in its integration of medical documentation—Emil's clinical notes, measurement records, and self-observations—with traditional narrative. This documentary realism serves not merely as historical backdrop but as a meditation on the limits of empirical knowledge when confronted with the mysteries of consciousness and suffering.
Set in fin de siècle Prague, the work examines a pivotal moment when the boundary between scientific progress and human dignity became increasingly contested. The city itself functions as a character, its ancient alchemical traditions and emerging medical institutions creating a landscape where the medieval and modern collide in uncanny harmony.
The relationship between Emil and Felix, an architectural preservationist, provides a crucial counterpoint, contrasting the preservation of buildings with the preservation of bodies and questioning what society deems worthy of salvation. Their friendship explores the tension between those who document decay and those who attempt to arrest it.
Through its unflinching examination of self-starvation and bodily autonomy, the novel poses essential questions about ownership of the body, the ethics of observation, and the fine line between research and obsession. The gothic elements serve not as mere aesthetic choice but as philosophical framework for examining the uncanny relationship between the living and the dead, the observer and the observed, the scientist and the specimen—ultimately questioning whether true preservation is ever possible or merely another form of destruction.

## Project Focus
This project weaves together multiple threads: the ethical complexities of medical research, the tension between scientific progress and human dignity, and the gothic atmosphere of fin de siècle Prague. Through Emil's deteriorating condition and his relationship with medical specimens and curiosities, the story examines the commodification of human bodies in medical science, the obsessive nature of self-documentation, and the thin line between researcher and research subject. The narrative explores how the period's fascination with medical specimens and anatomical curiosities reflected broader cultural attitudes toward death, disease, and the human body.
