Felix's Understanding of Emil

Felix would indeed have noticed Emil's "particular" habits, but his understanding would be filtered through:

His own naturally healthy relationship with food and body
The incomplete information he has about Emil's past
His genuine respect for Emil's boundaries and privacy
His artistic eye that sees Emil's physical changes more clearly than others

Felix's Perspective Timeline
I imagine it developing something like this:
University Years: Felix notices Emil is reserved, precise, and particular about certain habits, but attributes this to his serious academic nature.
Abroad Period: Felix studies in Vienna/Berlin/Paris for a year.
Return and Friendship: Returns to whispers about Emil's "nervous collapse" or "exhaustion," creating the perfect catalyst for their friendship. Felix, disliking gossip and malicious speculation, pointedly treats Emil normally - exactly what Emil needs.
Limited Understanding: Felix knows something happened, but has an incomplete picture - perhaps believing it was academic pressure, grief, or temporary nervous exhaustion.
Current Observation: Now witnessing Emil's gradual decline but interpreting it through the lens of:

Work pressure
Emil's "particular" nature
Concern about a recurrence of whatever happened before
Uncertainty about how to help without overstepping

This creates a beautiful tension where Felix sees more than most but still has crucial blind spots. He notices Emil's physical changes through his artist's eye, but misattributes the cause or severity.
