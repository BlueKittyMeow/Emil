# Story Ideas and TODOs

## Artistic Elements
- Include a painting created with authentic vintage mummy brown pigment
  - Ties thematically to the historical use of human remains in art and science
  - Creates a meta-connection to the specimen collection themes

## Plot Points to Develop

Parallels to "medical curiosities" - Emil might encounter medical literature or specimens related to "sexual inversion" (the period term), creating moments of self-recognition while highlighting how the medical gaze objectified all forms of human difference.

Period-appropriate coding - Using the language of "particular friendship" or "intimate companionship" that was common in period literature to denote same-sex attraction without explicit statement.

Medical self-observation - Emil could note his physical responses to Felix's presence in his clinical self-documentation, creating a poignant intersection of his medical and personal identities.

Architectural metaphors - Felix's discussions of preserving spaces that others would demolish could create resonant parallels to Emil preserving aspects of himself that society would erase.

## Misc Notes
- Title could involve something of the phrase from Prufrock "when I am fixed and wriggling on a pin".
