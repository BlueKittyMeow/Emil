- Is genuine connection possible when both parties are unreliable narrators of their own experience? IMPORTANT, MAJOR THEME. 

### Manipulation & Authenticity

- How does Klara balance real connection with planned exploitation?
- Does Emil's self-absorption make him complicit in his own exploitation? (umm yes)
- Can manipulation arise from a place of love?
- Does Klara's genuine understanding of Emil make her manipulation more or less ethical?

- What's the difference between Klara's chosen commodification and the Protégé's forced collection?
- How does Emil's academic position commodify illness differently?
- Where is the line between medical study and exploitation?
- How does institutional power influence bodily autonomy? Emil's academic position and autonomy is threatened by his use of his autonomy over his body. 

### Care & Sacrifice

- How does Klara's sacrifice mirror/contrast with Emil's self-destruction?
- Does her choice validate or challenge institutional objectification?

### Preservation & Destruction
- What's the relationship between preservation and destruction?

- What's being preserved in medical collections - knowledge or power? 
- Ties into questions of ethics in the biological specimen holdings of major universities and museums. 
- At what point does the collection become more important than the specimens themselves? 
- At what point does a collection become removed enough in time that it contains legitimate artifacts of human history (mummies, etc.) vs simple grave robbing and corpse looting?
