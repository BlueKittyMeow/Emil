Language Usage in Different Contexts
Professional Settings

Academic contexts: German was the dominant language of universities and scientific discourse
Medical settings: German for formal lectures, publications, and administrative matters
Emil's position: Would need excellent German for his academic work

Personal Conversations

Between Emil and Felix: Likely German primarily, as Felix's aristocratic background would make German his first language
Intimate conversations: Might include some code-switching between German and Czech, especially for Emil if expressing emotions or childhood memories

Social Settings

Coffee houses: Predominantly German in the more elegant establishments
Czech-oriented venues: Czech would be spoken in nationalist-leaning establishments
Salons: German was common in high society salons, though bilingualism was increasingly valued

Class Implications

German: Associated with authority, education, and high culture
Czech: Growing prestige with the national revival but still seen as the language of common people
Language choice: Often a political statement about one's allegiances

Multilingual Dynamics

Many educated Prague residents were functionally bilingual
Code-switching between languages was common
Some concepts might be expressed in one language rather than another
Deliberate language choices could signal intimacy or distance
Felix might surprise Emil occasionally with his knowledge of Czech expressions
Emil might maintain his professional German persona even in situations where Czech would be natural

For these characters specifically:

Emil would be fluent in both but might keep his Czech identity somewhat subdued in professional contexts
Felix would primarily speak German but might have learned Czech out of interest in local architecture and history
Their private conversations might involve a mix that evolved as their relationship deepened

Emil's German represents his professional identity and social aspiration
Emil's Czech connects to his emotional core and vulnerability
Felix's German is his birthright and natural mode
Felix's Czech represents his interest in crossing boundaries and connecting with Emil
Code-switching demonstrates the complex social landscape they navigate
Language choice becomes a subtle barometer of comfort, stress, and intimacy

For Emil specifically, language usage could track his emotional and physical state:

More rigid German when feeling threatened or insecure
Increased Czech when exhausted, emotional, or unwell
Deliberate language choices when managing public perception
Unconscious slippage revealing his true condition
