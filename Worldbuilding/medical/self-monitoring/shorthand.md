# Medical Self-Monitoring Shorthand System

## Food Portions
- /4 = quarter portion
- /2 = half portion
- X = full portion refused
- ✓ = full portion consumed
- ~ = partial portion (amount noted)

## Calorie Tracking
K followed by number = estimated calories
Example: K800 = approximately 800 calories

## Weight
W followed by number in stone and pounds
Example: W9.8 = 9 stone 8 pounds

## Pulse Rate
P followed by number and condition
- PR = resting pulse
- PE = post-exercise pulse
- PS = standing pulse
Example: PR72 = resting pulse of 72

## Room Temperature
T followed by number in Fahrenheit
Example: T68 = 68°F

## Exercise Units
- E followed by minutes of walking
- ES followed by flights of stairs
Example: E30 = 30 minutes walking
ES3 = 3 flights of stairs

## Ketone Testing
- KT- = negative
- KT+ = trace
- KT++ = moderate
- KT+++ = large

# Record-Keeping and Shorthand
Emil might develop a personal shorthand system like:
G-3/4 + K-1/3 + B-sm [66.3] → W 7.2
P: 82 (r) / 97 (p) • RT: 36.2 • E: 1.5U
K: +1

Translation:

G-3/4: Graubrot (gray bread) - 3/4 portion
K-1/3: Käse (cheese) - 1/3 portion
B-sm: Brühe (broth) - small amount
[66.3]: Total calculated calories
W 7.2: Weight 7.2 kg below his "baseline" weight (to obscure actual weight)
P: 82 (r) / 97 (p): Pulse 82 at rest, 97 post-exertion
RT: 36.2: Room temperature 36.2°C
E: 1.5U: Exercise - 1.5 units (might represent hours or kilometers)
K: +1: Ketone test result (+1 indicating slight presence)
