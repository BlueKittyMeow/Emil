### Central Tragedy
Jan taught Emil to recognize exploitation but inadvertently provided tools for self-exploitation. The uncle who meant to protect Emil from becoming a medical specimen taught him to make himself into one using professional medical knowledge.

### Potential for Resolution
As the only person with both historical knowledge of Gull's cases and family authority over Emil, Jan represented the key to potential intervention - if he could have overcome his blindness to see the connection between his Edinburgh stories and Emil's current crisis.
