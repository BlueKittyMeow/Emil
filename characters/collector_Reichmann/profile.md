## Overview
- Recently deceased at start of story
- Wealthy and respected in life
- Maintained facade of scientific interest
- Hidden obsession with "medical anomalies"
- Left some of his collection to museum/university
- The darker elements of his collection were kept hidden and fell into the hands of the protégé after his death. The semi-forgotten papers and notes that Felix finds in the property speak to the existence of a much larger collection than was ever publicly known, with its darker elements. This is what initially awakens Felix's concerns and desire to look deeper.
