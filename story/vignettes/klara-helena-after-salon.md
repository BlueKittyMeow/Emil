 Klara and Helena's Private Moment
Klara's private rooms, evening
"It's worse after the salon," Klara said, wincing as Helena gently worked the brush through her hair. "All those hours of holding myself just so."
Helena's movements were practiced, careful around the areas where Klara's condition had begun to fuse her cervical vertebrae. "You pushed too hard today. I saw you speaking with that doctor for nearly an hour."
"Emil Králik," Klara confirmed. "He's fascinating—watching him is like looking in a distorted mirror. He's disappearing while I'm turning to stone."
Helena set down the brush, moving to prepare the evening medication. "Did you get what you needed from him?"
"Information about the Collector's protégé, yes. Emil doesn't realize how much he reveals when discussing his research." Klara accepted the medication, grimacing at the taste. "The Protégé has approached him professionally. It's beginning."
"Then we should accelerate our timeline," Helena said, her voice steady despite the implications.
Klara reached for Helena's hand, her grip surprisingly strong. "My mother's arrangements?"
"Nearly complete. The house in Vienna is secured, staff hired, medical care arranged." Helena knelt beside Klara's chair. "Are you certain about this path?"
"As certain as the progression of my condition." Klara's eyes held Helena's. "Better to choose the manner of my preservation than wait for it to claim me inch by inch."
Helena's composed expression revealed nothing of the cost behind her next words. "Then I will help you prepare."
