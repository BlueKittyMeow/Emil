The drawing room walls seemed to shift imperceptibly, their burgundy pattern breathing with the lamplight. Emil maintained his position in the leather chair, hands clasped with deliberate steadiness while conversations drifted around him like water around stones. The dinner had concluded an hour past. His stomach had stopped its protests sometime before the second course.
Now came the reckoning.
Professor Weber's voice emerged from a great distance, discussing some matter of university politics that required appropriate facial expressions. Emil arranged his features carefully. The effort of maintaining focus created a peculiar floating sensation, as though his consciousness observed from somewhere above his left shoulder.
His hands had begun their treachery twenty minutes earlier.
The tremor started in his fingertips—barely perceptible, a flutter that might suggest nervous energy to casual observation. Emil pressed his palms together in an attitude of thoughtful attention. The trembling intensified.
"Dr. Králik?" Professor Weber's voice penetrated the strange cotton that seemed to muffle all sound. "Your thoughts on the laboratory expansion?"
Words formed themselves with curious difficulty. "The proposal merits... careful consideration."
The response emerged with reasonable coherence though the act of speech required concentrated effort. Emil noted with clinical detachment how his voice seemed to originate from some distant location, traveling through layers of gauze before reaching his mouth.
The room wavered slightly at the edges.
Dr. Hoffman approached with a crystal decanter, amber liquid catching the gaslight. "Brandy? Excellent vintage."
Emil observed his own hand rise to cover the glass—a movement that appeared to occur in slow segments, like frames of a magic lantern show projected at incorrect speed. "Thank you, no. Early morning tomorrow."
The decline of the offer required enormous precision. His voice must convey professional duty rather than physical incapacity. The effort left him momentarily depleted.
His vision began to narrow.
The peripheral darkness crept inward with dreamlike inevitability, reducing the drawing room to a tunnel of amber light centered on Professor Weber's gesticulating hands. The phenomenon struck Emil as academically interesting. He had read descriptions of visual field restriction in medical literature but never experienced the peculiar intimacy of the effect.
Sound became curiously selective. Professor Weber's words drifted in and out of comprehensibility while the clock's ticking grew unnaturally prominent, each mechanism striking his consciousness with brass clarity.
The hunger itself had transformed.
What had begun as mere emptiness had evolved into something more complex—a hollow expansion that seemed to occupy more space than his actual torso. The sensation suggested an architectural impossibility, as though his body contained chambers that extended beyond its physical boundaries.
He pressed his hands more firmly together. The trembling had progressed beyond his control.
Dr. Bartoš materialized beside his chair with the sudden clarity that objects possess in peripheral vision. "You're looking rather pale, Králik. The strain of the term, perhaps?"
Emil marshaled his resources for response. "The evening's discussion has been... stimulating."
Each word required individual attention, careful articulation to prevent slurring. His tongue felt disconnected from his conscious direction, a foreign mechanism requiring manual operation.
The sensation of floating intensified.
His consciousness seemed to hover above the scene, observing with detached interest as Emil-in-the-chair maintained appropriate social responses while his body systematically failed. The division struck him as remarkable—how completely the mind could separate from its physical housing during periods of extreme depletion.
Professor Weber continued speaking about laboratory renovations. Emil nodded at regular intervals, a metronome of attention that required no actual comprehension. The words dissolved into meaningful rhythms rather than specific content.
His hands betrayed him completely.
The tremor had progressed to visible shaking despite his clasped position. Emil shifted his arms, attempting to conceal the trembling within the natural gestures of conversation. The movement caused a wave of dizziness that threatened his careful equilibrium.
The room tilted gently to the left.
Emil corrected his posture with minute adjustments, grateful that the leather chair provided substantial support. The sensation of tilting continued, as though he sat aboard a ship in moderate seas. The metaphor pleased his detached consciousness—he was indeed navigating uncertain waters, maintaining course through increasingly challenging conditions.
"The chemical storage requirements alone..." Professor Weber's voice faded in and out like a poorly tuned wireless signal.
Emil produced appropriate murmurs of agreement. The effort cost him more than it should. His energy reserves had dwindled to critical levels, each social interaction drawing from rapidly depleting stores.
The hunger began to sing.
A high, thin note had developed somewhere in his consciousness—not audible in any conventional sense, but persistently present like the whistle of wind through a barely opened window. The sound possessed an oddly musical quality that might have been pleasant under different circumstances.
His vision continued its contraction until the drawing room existed as a small circle of comprehensible reality surrounded by soft darkness. Within this reduced theater, Professor Weber's hands moved with exaggerated clarity while his face dissolved into impressionistic suggestion.
Dr. Hoffman approached again, this time offering a plate of small cakes. The scent struck Emil with unexpected violence—butter and sugar and flour combining into an olfactory assault that caused his stomach to contract with sudden, vicious hunger.
The sensation lasted perhaps three seconds. Then the emptiness returned, more profound than before.
"Thank you, no." Emil's voice emerged as barely more than whisper. "Quite satisfied from dinner."
The lie required all his remaining energy. Dr. Hoffman moved away, carrying the plate and its dangerous cargo of actual nourishment.
Emil's hands shook openly now.
He could no longer maintain the pretense of control. The trembling had become constant, visible to anyone who cared to observe. His only hope lay in the assumption that his colleagues would attribute the shaking to fatigue or perhaps excessive coffee consumption.
The floating sensation reached new heights. Emil observed from his elevated perspective as his body slumped slightly in the chair, the careful posture finally succumbing to gravitational inevitability. His head felt extraordinarily light, as though it might detach and drift toward the ceiling like a child's balloon.
Professor Weber's voice became increasingly distant. "...most remarkable case of neural adaptation..."
The words held meaning somewhere beyond Emil's current reach. He nodded with practiced regularity while his consciousness retreated further from immediate sensation. The hunger had transcended mere physical discomfort, achieving a state that felt almost transcendent.
Almost holy.
The room wavered like heat shimmer above summer pavement. Emil gripped the chair arms with trembling hands and smiled appropriately at Professor Weber's conclusion.

The speeches concluded with the merciful finality of a closing door. Emil remained motionless in his chair, contemplating the archaeological mystery of the evening's consumption. Had he actually eaten anything? His memory retained fragments—a spoon lifted toward his mouth, the motion of chewing, appropriate intervals of swallowing. Yet his stomach's hollow certainty suggested otherwise.
Perhaps there were biscuits secreted in his jacket pockets, evidence of unconscious sleight of hand. The possibility struck him as both hopeful and horrifying.
Professor Weber gathered his papers with bureaucratic efficiency. Dr. Hoffman extinguished several lamps. The room's population began its natural dispersion toward coats and carriages and the ordinary demands of evening's end.
Emil sat. The leather chair had become both refuge and trap.
Standing would require a complex sequence of mechanical actions—the shift of weight, the coordination of muscles, the delicate negotiations between intention and capability. His legs felt distant and theoretical, architectural elements whose structural integrity remained questionable.
He reached for his notebook with deliberate casualness.
The leather folio lay within arm's reach, a prop of scholarly necessity. Emil opened it to a page of chemical formulas, allowing his expression to suggest sudden professional inspiration. The ruse bought precious minutes while his circulatory system attempted to redistribute its meager resources.
"Fascinating correlation," he murmured to no one in particular, pencil moving across paper in meaningless notation.
The room continued its exodus around him. Footsteps retreated down corridors. Voices faded into administrative distance. Emil maintained his pose of intellectual absorption while his body gathered strength for the coming performance.
Then Felix appeared.
The arrival occurred with the startling clarity of figures emerging from fog. One moment Emil sat alone with his notebook, the next Felix stood three feet away, solid and immediate and impossibly present. The transition struck Emil as cinematographic—frames spliced together without proper continuity.
"Emil." Felix's voice carried notes of... something. Concern? Professional courtesy? The emotional register eluded analysis.
Emil looked up from his notebook, the movement requiring conscious effort. Felix's face swam into focus with curious delay, features assembling themselves like a photograph developing in chemical solution. The familiar architecture of cheekbones and jaw, the particular quality of Felix's attention.
Beautiful. Felix remained beautiful with the maddening consistency that had tormented Emil for years.
"Felix." The name emerged correctly, a small triumph of linguistic coordination.
But something else flickered at the edges of recognition. Felix here, now, in the medical faculty's evening aftermath—the logic escaped Emil's depleted analytical capacity. His consciousness reached through layers of exhaustion, searching for the connecting thread.
Felix moved closer, his outline wavering slightly in Emil's peripheral vision. The physical contrast struck Emil with its usual violence. Felix's natural elegance, the easy grace of properly nourished limbs, the casual confidence of a body that served rather than betrayed its occupant.
Emil's calculations remained constant despite the visual distortion. Still not thin enough. Still requiring reduction. The mathematical certainty persisted even as his vision swam and Felix's figure seemed to multiply briefly before resolving back into singular focus.
"You look..." Felix paused, his expression suggesting professional evaluation. "Have you been working late in the laboratory again?"
The question drifted toward Emil through layers of cotton wool. Working. Laboratory. Yes, those were activities he performed, though their recent chronology had dissolved into impressionistic blur.
"Research demands..." Emil began, then lost the thread of his response. The words scattered like startled birds before reaching completion.
Felix waited with the patience Emil associated with their university years. Something about preservation, archives, documentation. The connection lurked beneath the surface of Emil's awareness like a fish in murky water, visible but not quite graspable.
Why was Felix here? Among the medical faculty? In the aftermath of clinical discussions?
Emil's memory performed sluggish excavation, dredging fragments from the evening's sediment. Professor Weber's voice. Laboratory expansion. Chemical storage. And before that... what had preceded the drawing room gathering?
The folio of papers slipped slightly in Emil's trembling hands. Felix's gaze tracked the movement with sharp attention that made Emil's skin contract despite the warmth of the room.
"The university bequest," Felix said slowly, as though offering assistance with a difficult translation. "The medical collection transfer. You asked me to attend the preliminary discussion."
The words arranged themselves into meaning with dreamlike delay. Yes. The collection. Historical medical artifacts requiring proper preservation techniques. Emil had suggested Felix's expertise might prove valuable, though the specific reasoning now escaped him.
Felix's presence here represented Emil's own invitation, issued when his cognitive functions had operated with greater reliability. The irony struck him as academically interesting—he had summoned the one person whose proximity made concealment most difficult.
"Of course." Emil closed his notebook with careful precision. "Your recommendations regarding environmental controls."
The response emerged from some automatic reserve of professional vocabulary. Felix nodded, though his expression suggested continued evaluation of Emil's condition.
The necessity of standing loomed with increasing urgency. Other faculty members had departed. The drawing room's emptiness made Emil's continued sitting progressively more conspicuous.
Felix extended his hand in a gesture that might appear helpful to casual observation.
Emil stared at the offered assistance, recognizing both salvation and exposure in the simple movement. To accept would acknowledge his need; to refuse would require independent mobility that might exceed his current capabilities.

Mudlarking is a dirty business and more a morass when done in ones own mind. Sinkholes suck at his shoes, the slick mud of the psyche hiding deep wells that waited treacherously. 

Emil's consciousness descended into the murky shallows of immediate decision. His mind worked like a mudlark at low tide, searching through the psychological sediment for useful fragments of memory and intention. Each thought emerged coated in the slick residue of exhaustion.
Felix's hand remained extended. The gesture hung in the space between them like a question awaiting translation.
Emil's internal excavation continued its treacherous work. Why had he suggested Felix's involvement in the medical collection transfer? The reasoning lay buried somewhere beneath layers of accumulated fatigue, a valuable artifact that might illuminate current circumstances if only he could extract it intact.
His mental footing shifted unexpectedly. A sinkhole of dizziness opened beneath his attempts at coherent thought. Emil gripped his notebook more tightly, anchor against the slipping ground of consciousness.
"The humidity controls you mentioned," Emil heard himself say, the words emerging from some automatic archive of professional conversation. "For the organic specimens."
Felix nodded, though his attention remained fixed on Emil's face with uncomfortable precision. "The basement storage requires complete environmental overhaul. Temperature fluctuations alone could damage the preserved materials beyond recovery."
The technical discussion provided momentary solid ground. Emil's professional training supplied appropriate responses even as his deeper awareness continued its desperate mudlarking through increasingly treacherous cognitive terrain.
But something else shifted in the sediment. A memory fragment surfaced, coated in the particular slime of half-forgotten significance. The collection transfer wasn't merely academic consultation. There had been irregularities in the documentation. Questions about provenance. Felix had discovered... what had Felix discovered?
The thought slipped away before Emil could grasp it completely.
His body made the decision independently. Emil pushed against the chair arms, attempting to rise through pure muscular determination. The action sent shock waves through his depleted system. The room performed a slow revolution around its vertical axis.
Felix moved closer without apparent decision, his presence suddenly solid and steadying though Emil could not recall accepting the offered assistance.
"Easy." Felix's voice carried the particular gentleness reserved for laboratory glassware or delicate archival materials. "No need to rush."
Emil found himself vertical through mechanisms he could not entirely account for. His legs had apparently remembered their structural function despite his consciousness remaining several steps behind the physical transition. Felix's hand rested lightly against his elbow—a contact that felt both essential and mortifying.
The mudlarking in his mind struck another treacherous pocket. Memory fragments swirled in the disturbed sediment: Felix's expression when describing certain specimens in the collection. Something about dates that didn't align properly. Documentation gaps that suggested...
Again the thought dissolved before reaching complete formation.
"The carriage," Emil said, though he had no clear recollection of ordering one. The words seemed to arrive from the same automatic reserves that had managed his earlier social responses.
Felix guided him toward the door with movements so subtle they might appear casual to any remaining observer. Emil appreciated the professional discretion even as his pride writhed at the necessity.
"I've arranged transport," Felix replied. "My driver can manage both destinations."
Both destinations. Emil's archaeological consciousness struggled with this phrase. Felix lived in the opposite direction from Emil's lodgings. The inefficiency struck him as significant though he could not quite grasp why.
They moved through corridors that seemed to stretch and contract like accordion pleats. Emil's visual field had narrowed to a tunnel of comprehensible reality with Felix's shoulder as its fixed point of reference. Other architectural details dissolved into impressionistic suggestion.
The night air struck his face with shocking clarity. Emil gasped involuntarily, the cold cutting through layers of exhaustion to deliver actual sensation. Stars appeared with startling definition against the Prague sky.
Felix continued his steady guidance toward a waiting carriage, though Emil could not remember the specific mechanics of their arrival at curbside. Time had developed gaps and inconsistencies like a poorly edited manuscript.
The carriage door opened. Emil contemplated the step upward with the same careful evaluation he might apply to scaling a significant geological formation.
"One moment," he said, gripping the door frame while his system attempted to negotiate the transition between horizontal and vertical planes of movement.
Felix waited with the infinite patience Emil associated with his archival work. No hurry. No visible impatience. Simply steady presence while Emil's body performed its complex calculations of balance and momentum.
In the muddy depths of his consciousness, something else stirred. A fragment of earlier conversation that had sunk without proper examination. Felix had mentioned the collection's documentation problems. Specimens that appeared too recent for their supposed historical provenance.
Emil's grip on the door frame tightened. The implication began to surface through the psychological silt, emerging piece by piece like a skeleton assembled from scattered bones.
But the effort of climbing into the carriage demanded his immediate attention. Emil hauled himself upward through pure determination, Felix's steadying hand making the transition possible if not graceful.
The carriage interior enveloped him in leather-scented dimness. Emil collapsed against the cushions, his body finally acknowledging the evening's accumulated costs.
Felix settled opposite him with characteristic economy of movement. The driver's voice murmured something about destinations. Instructions were exchanged through the communication window.
Emil closed his eyes, abandoning the archaeological expedition through his compromised consciousness. The fragments would have to remain buried for now. His mental mudlarking had stirred too much sediment, obscuring rather than illuminating the treasures hidden in the depths.
The carriage began its rocking progress through Prague's cobbled streets, carrying them both toward whatever revelations morning might deliver.

Emil pressed his spine against the carriage seat, summoning the last reserves of postural discipline. His shoulders aligned with military precision. His hands arranged themselves with deliberate symmetry against his thighs. For thirty seconds, perhaps forty, he maintained the architecture of professional composure.
Then his muscles began their rebellion.
The effort of sustained tension triggered something deeper in his depleted system. What had begun as voluntary control transformed into involuntary spasm. His shoulders jumped once, twice, then settled into a rapid flutter that spread down his arms like electricity seeking ground.
Emil abandoned the attempt. His spine curved forward, shoulders collapsing inward as he surrendered to gravitational inevitability.
The shaking intensified immediately.
Released from conscious suppression, the tremor exploded through his entire frame. His hands drummed against his legs in staccato percussion. His head bobbed with each jolt of the carriage wheels against cobblestone. The vibration seemed to originate from his very bones, radiating outward through muscle and sinew until his entire body operated as a tuning fork struck against the evening's accumulated strain.
Felix said nothing. Emil could sense his friend's attention without meeting his gaze, could feel the weight of professional assessment being applied to his condition with the same careful precision Felix brought to evaluating deteriorated manuscripts.
The carriage rounded a corner. Emil's body swayed with the motion, the shaking making him seem loose-jointed as a marionette operated by inexperienced hands. He gripped the edge of the seat, seeking stability, but his fingers lacked the strength for proper purchase.
Then his stomach growled.
It clawed its way out, the growl of some caged animal. 
The sound had been unmistakably that of profound hunger — not the polite emptiness one might experience before a delayed meal, but the desperate protest of a body systematically denied sustenance.
Felix's silence stretched across the carriage interior like a physical presence. Emil could not bring himself to look up, could not face whatever expression of understanding or concern might be written across his friend's features.
The shaking had not abated. If anything, the protestations of hunger had triggered fresh waves of tremor that now included a fine oscillation of his jaw that made his teeth chatter softly in rhythm with the carriage wheels.
Another growl began to build in his abdomen. Emil pressed a shaking hand firmly against his stomach, applying direct pressure to suppress any further vocal rebellion. The effort required concentration that made his head swim with fresh dizziness.
"Emil." Felix's voice carried no judgment, no surprise, only a plaintiveness that somehow made the exposure more complete than any expression of shock might have accomplished.
Emil kept his eyes fixed on his trembling hands. His stomach gave another muffled protest beneath his palm, quieter now but still audible in the confined space. The hunger had announced itself with perfect clarity, stripping away months of careful deception in a single, involuntary moment.
