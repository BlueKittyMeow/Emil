The Confrontation Scene
This would be an incredible character moment:
Felix's apartment, evening after Emil receives most disturbing letter yet
"You've been receiving these for how long?" Felix's voice remained controlled, but the muscle in his jaw tensed visibly.
Emil stood by the window, arms folded. "The first arrived three weeks ago."
"Three weeks." Felix placed the letters on the table with precise movements. "And you didn't think to mention them."
"They were clearly meant to frighten us away from the investigation."
"Us?" Felix looked up. "Yet I'm only seeing them now."
Emil turned to face the window. "I saw no reason to cause unnecessary concern."
"Unnecessary?" Felix lifted one letter. "'Your clavicles cast perfect shadows across your chest when you lecture.' This doesn't concern you?"
Emil's reflection in the glass remained perfectly composed. "The ravings of a disturbed mind."
"A disturbed mind who has been watching you. Following you." Felix spread the letters across the table. "Measuring you."
"Which is precisely why I didn't show you. I knew you would overreact."
Felix stood, approaching Emil but stopping short of touching him. "This isn't about the investigation anymore. This person sees you as a... specimen."
Emil's carefully maintained facade cracked slightly. "Which is absurd. I'm not—"
"Not what?" Felix's voice softened dangerously. "Not thin enough? Not disciplined enough? Not far enough along in your transformation to qualify for his collection?"
Emil turned, his composure slipping further. "That's not—"
"He sees what I see, Emil. What everyone sees but you refuse to acknowledge."
The silence between them expanded, filled with years of unspoken observations and careful avoidances.
"We need to take these to the authorities," Felix finally said.
"And tell them what? That I'm being stalked by the mysterious associate of a dead collector? That he finds my physical condition fascinating?" Emil's voice held a bitter edge. "They'll be far more interested in why he finds me worth observing than in finding him."
Felix gathered the letters. "Then we find him ourselves. But we do it together. No more secrets."
Emil turned back to the window, his reflection now visibly shaken. "He sees me."
"So do I," Felix replied quietly. "I always have."
