Emil Code-Switching When Exhausted
Felix's apartment, very late at night after a demanding faculty meeting
"The committee rejected Wagner's proposal outright," Emil explained, pacing despite his obvious exhaustion. "His methodology was fundamentally flawed. I attempted to explain the deficiencies in his experimental design but was interrupted by that insufferable Doktor Hoffman."
Felix watched from his chair, noting the slight sway in Emil's movements.
"Hoffman suggested that my own research was similarly problematic, which is absolute—" Emil gestured sharply, searching for the precise German term. "Nesmysl," he finished in Czech, frustrated.
"Nonsense," Felix supplied in German.
"Ano, přesně tak—yes, exactly," Emil continued, the languages beginning to blend as his exhaustion deepened. "His critique was entirely nepodložený—unfounded—and demonstrated a complete nepochopení—misunderstanding—of the basic principles involved."
With each sentence, more Czech words slipped in, his careful professional veneer cracking under fatigue.
Felix rose and guided Emil to sit. "Perhaps continue this in the morning? Your argument will be stronger after rest."
Emil looked momentarily confused, as if only now realizing he had been switching languages. "Promiň—I apologize. My German appears to be deserting me."
"Your thoughts are clear in any language," Felix replied simply. "But perhaps clearer after sleep."
