Emil Using German When Threatened
At Anton's grocery, late afternoon, when Emil has been unsteady after too little food and too much walking
"More broth today, Pan Doktor?" Anton asked in Czech, measuring out the thin liquid. "My wife made it fresh this morning."
Emil nodded, watching the broth being poured with careful attention. "Just this, thank you."
Anton frowned, pausing with the ladle. "You're looking pale today. Perhaps some proper soup instead? With meat and vegetables? My wife worried when she saw you yesterday."
Emil's posture stiffened immediately. "Das ist nicht n√∂tig, Herr Anton," he replied in crisp, formal German. "The broth is quite sufficient. I have a full schedule of lectures and laboratory work requiring mental clarity."
Anton recoiled slightly at the language shift, the social barrier suddenly reinforced between them. "Of course, Herr Doktor. Just the broth then."
Emil maintained the formal German until leaving the shop, the language a shield against the grocer's well-meaning concern.
