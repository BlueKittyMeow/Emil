Felix's Czech as Subtle Intimacy
Late evening in Felix's study, after Emil had pushed himself too hard during a research session
Emil's hands trembled slightly as he attempted to organize his notes, papers slipping from his grasp for the third time.
Felix, who had been sketching in the corner, set aside his work and crossed the room without comment. He gathered the fallen pages and placed them in a neat stack on the desk.
"Odpočiň si," Felix said quietly, the Czech words for "rest yourself" spoken with only a slight accent. "Počká to do rána." It will wait until morning.
Emil looked up, startled not by the suggestion but by the language. Felix rarely spoke Czech, and never in professional contexts. The mother-tongue intimacy of it caught him more off-guard than any German endearment could have.
"My Czech is terrible, I know," Felix said, switching back to German with a self-deprecating smile. "But some things are better said directly."
Emil found himself unable to maintain his usual professional distance. "Není to tak špatné," he replied. It's not so bad. "Your accent is improving."
