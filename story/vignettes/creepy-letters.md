"Your calculation methods for energy expenditure are remarkably precise. The formula you developed on April 17th particularly impressed me - though I believe you underestimated the caloric deficit by approximately 17.3%. I've taken the liberty of correcting the relevant entries in your ledger."

The Letters: Evolution of Obsession
First Letter: Threatening but Intriguing
Found on Emil's desk at the university after initial investigation
Dr. Králik,
Your inquiries regarding Dr. Reichmann's collection have not gone unnoticed. I strongly advise you to direct your considerable analytical skills elsewhere. The foundation's representatives have been most accommodating, but their knowledge is necessarily limited.
Some matters are best left undisturbed, particularly by those whose own fragility might not withstand scrutiny. I observed your lecture on anesthetic compounds yesterday—the precision with which you control your movements despite your evident physical discipline is remarkable. Few would notice the calculation behind each gesture, but I recognize the careful choreography required to maintain such perfect control.
Consider this a professional courtesy between those who appreciate precision. Reichmann's collection is a closed matter. Your continued investigation will force responses I would prefer to avoid.
Regard this as my only warning.

Mid-Point Letter: Shifting Focus
Delivered to Emil's apartment door
Dr. Králik,
Despite my warning, you persisted. I anticipated professional curiosity, but your determination suggests something more personal. Perhaps you recognize elements of yourself in what you've discovered? The systematic documentation of physical transformation connects us all.
I've been studying your routines. The 5:23 AM measurements. The precisely timed walks. The careful food journal disguised as research notes. The hidden scale behind your dressing screen. Such meticulous self-observation is rare outside my circles.
Your colleague von Rothenberg doesn't see the full extent of your work, does he? He observes but doesn't truly understand. His sketches capture your external transformation, but miss the internal architecture of your discipline.
I've enclosed a small token—a page from Reichmann's personal collection notes. You'll find his observations on a similar case from 1878. The subject survived only nine months after documentation began. You've already exceeded that timeline considerably, suggesting superior methodology.
We have much to discuss when you're prepared to acknowledge our shared interests.
Until then, I remain an admirer of your work.

Late-Stage Letter: Clinical Obsession
Left beside Emil's bed while he slept
My dear Emil,
Formalities seem unnecessary at this point. I've spent enough nights observing your sleep patterns to warrant first-name intimacy. Your nocturnal tremors have increased by approximately 12% since my first documentation. The correlation with your daytime caloric intake (per your meticulous records) provides fascinating data.
I've taken the liberty of correcting several calculations in your notebook. Your Quetelet index calculations were surprisingly inaccurate—perhaps a deliberate self-deception? The actual figure places you squarely within parameters that interest me professionally.
Your self-created specimen status presents unique opportunities. Most subjects in collections represent involuntary transformations, but yours is a masterpiece of deliberate re-engineering. The conscious reduction of physical form through systematic restriction—documented by both subject and observer—has no equal in existing collections.
I've prepared a place for you in my expanded collection. Unlike Reichmann's primitive preservation methods, my approach allows for continued documentation of living specimens. You would be the centerpiece—the self-documenting subject whose transformation continues under observation.
Your friend von Rothenberg has become problematic. His protective instincts, while understandable, interfere with natural progression. The logical solution is clear, though unfortunate.
I'll visit again tonight. Sleep well, Emil. Soon your work will be properly archived and appreciated.
With professional admiration,
A Colleague
