The examination committee had convened at half past ten. Now the clock's hands approached three, and the carved faces on the committee room's wainscoting seemed to shift in Emil's peripheral vision, their wooden mouths opening and closing in silent mastication.
Someone had ordered refreshments.
The porter arranged them on the sideboard with methodical precision: sliced meats glistening with their own oils, wheels of cheese releasing their sharp perfume into the closed air, fresh rolls still bearing warmth from the baker's ovens. The smell infiltrated everything—the papers before him, the wool of his sleeve, the very molecules of air he was forced to breathe.
Emil pressed his right hand flat against his thigh beneath the table. The tremor had begun an hour ago, a fine vibration like a tuning fork struck and left to sing. His left hand gripped the pen with excessive force, the knuckles white as exposed bone.
"Dr. Králik, your assessment of the candidate's methodology?"
The words floated across the vast distance of the table. Professor Weber's face appeared to recede and advance by turns, as though viewed through a telescope someone was adjusting. Emil heard his own voice emerge, surprisingly steady: "The experimental design shows promise, though the controls require refinement."
His stomach had ceased its protests hours ago. Now it existed as a hollow carved into his center, a void that pulled at the edges of his vision. The room's gas fixtures bloomed with halos.
Dr. Novotny was eating. The man had helped himself to the refreshments during the last recess, and crumbs still clung to his beard. Each time he spoke, they danced. Emil found himself counting them. Seven. Now six. The lost crumb had fallen to the paper before Novotny, a tiny planet on the white expanse.
"Gentlemen, shall we break for refreshment?" The committee chair's suggestion rippled through the room.
Emil's hand jerked involuntarily toward the table edge. He converted the motion into a gesture of checking his watch. "I believe we're near conclusion. Perhaps we might finish?"
But already the others were rising, moving toward the sideboard with the inexorable purpose of men who had lunched lightly in anticipation of the committee's hospitality. Emil remained seated, shuffling papers with elaborate attention.
The smell intensified. Butter. Salt. The yeast-sweet interior of fresh bread. Someone had sliced a roll in half, and Emil could see the steam rising from its opened heart, delicate as souls ascending.
He stood. The room tilted.
"Are you well, Králik?" Weber materialized at his elbow, solid and concerned.
"Perfectly." Emil gripped the table edge. The wood felt soft beneath his fingers, as though he might leave impressions like a medieval saint. "The close air. Perhaps I'll step onto the balcony."
He moved toward the French doors with careful steps. Each placement of foot required consideration. The parquet floor had developed a concerning elasticity, giving slightly beneath his weight like flesh.
On the balcony, the November air struck like a slap. Good. The cold sharpened the edges of things, brought the university courtyard back into proper focus. Below, students crossed between buildings, their forms dark and definite against the frost-white ground.
His hands shook freely now, hidden in his pockets. The tremor had spread upward, a subtle electricity running beneath his skin. Inside, laughter erupted—someone had made a jest about the candidate's German grammar. The sound carried a physical weight, pressing against Emil's skull.
When he turned back to the doors, Felix stood on the other side of the glass.
Not truly Felix—Emil knew this even as his hunger-loosened mind supplied the details with hallucinatory precision. Felix wasn't on the examination committee. But there he stood regardless, holding a plate of food with that particular gesture of casual grace, speaking to Weber while his free hand sketched shapes in the air.
Emil blinked hard. The figure resolved into Dr. Procházka, stout and bearded and nothing like Felix at all.
Inside, the committee reassembled. Emil navigated back to his seat, noting how the other men's faces had taken on a satisfied sheen. Plates dotted the table now, casualties of academic appetite. A slice of ham lay abandoned inches from Emil's papers, its edges curling.
"Now then, the matter of publication requirements." The chair's voice seemed to originate from very far away, or perhaps from inside Emil's own skull.
Emil's pen moved across paper, recording opinions and objections. The words appeared in his own hand, properly formed, though he had no memory of writing them. His vision had developed a curious quality, as though he were looking up through water at the wavering surface world above.
Time dilated. Contracted. The committee members' mouths moved in elaborate patterns that might have been speech or might have been chewing or might have been the complex motions of some marine creatures he had once seen preserved in glass jars.
"...conclude this portion of the examination," someone said.
Emil heard himself agreeing to something. Papers rustled. Chairs scraped. The other men were standing, and so Emil stood too, his hand finding the table edge with the instinct of a blind creature.
"Excellent work today, gentlemen." The chair's satisfaction radiated like heat. "The final determination on Monday, then?"
Agreement rippled through the room. Emil nodded with the rest, though Monday existed in some impossible future beyond the immediate necessity of remaining upright.
The hallway stretched before him, a tunnel of dark wood and intermittent gas lamps. He moved through it with deliberate calm, each step a small victory over the peculiar weightlessness that threatened to carry him up toward the vaulted ceiling.
In his office, Emil locked the door and sank into his desk chair. The room spun gently, a carousel viewed from its center. On his desk, his morning coffee cup sat exactly where he had left it, a brown ring dried in its bottom like a fossil record of appetite refused.
His hands, when he held them before his face, shook with the rapid tremor of hummingbird wings.

Abstractly, as if such things were purely hypothetical, Emil considered the situation. 

The problem presented itself as a geometric equation. His office to the building entrance: forty-seven steps down the main corridor, a right turn, twenty-three steps to the heavy doors. Then the courtyard, its diagonal path offering the shortest route but requiring navigation around the fountain. After that, the gates, the street, the series of turns and straightaways that comprised his usual route home.
Emil regarded his hands with scientific interest. They had ceased their trembling and adopted a curious lassitude, as though the bones had been replaced with some more flexible material. When he attempted to make a fist, the fingers responded with notable delay, closing in sequence like a slow-motion study of muscular action.
The chair held him with unexpected tenacity. Rising would require a coordinated effort between multiple muscle groups, a symphony of neural signals and mechanical responses that seemed, at present, beyond his conducting abilities.
He might remain here. The office had a perfectly serviceable chair. The door was locked. In the morning—but no, the morning brought lectures, students, the elaborate performance of professorial competence.
Walking. He had walked extraordinary distances under worse conditions. The body, properly directed, could achieve remarkable feats through will alone. This was simply a matter of breaking the journey into manageable segments.
First, standing.
He gripped the desk edge and hauled himself upward. His legs performed their function, though they seemed to belong to someone else, some distant acquaintance whose movements he was observing with polite interest. The room swayed, steadied, swayed again in a rhythm that might have been his pulse or the building settling or the earth itself rotating on its axis.
The door. Key in lock. The mechanical action required three attempts, his fingers refusing the delicate coordination necessary for such precise work. But then—success. The hallway opened before him, blessedly empty of colleagues who might note his careful progress along the wall.
Forty-seven steps. He counted them with the attention of a naturalist recording specimens. Each footfall required individual consideration, placement, weight transfer. His body had become a fascinating puzzle, its operations no longer automatic but demanding conscious oversight.
The main doors loomed with their brass fixtures and weight. He would need momentum. Emil stepped back, gathered what resources remained, and pushed forward. The door yielded, and he emerged into the courtyard's grey light like some deep-sea creature breaking the surface.
The fountain. He had not accounted for the thin layer of ice that glazed the cobblestones around it. His foot skidded, and for a moment he existed in pure suspension, neither falling nor standing, occupying some liminal space between states.
His hand found the fountain's edge. The stone was cold enough to burn through his glove, shocking his nerves back into temporary cooperation. He stood still, breathing the sharp air, watching students pass in their dark coats like figures in a diorama.
The journey home stretched before him, a map drawn in uncertain ink. He might take a carriage—but that would require hailing one, explaining his destination, managing the step up into the conveyance. These actions seemed to require more coordination than his current reserves allowed.
Walking, then. One foot before the other, that ancient human rhythm. He had once calculated the exact number of steps from university to lodgings: one thousand three hundred and sixty-two. A finite number. Achievable.
Emil released the fountain and began.

The architectural building materialized on his right, its sandstone facade the color of old bone in the failing light. Emil had not intended to take this route. His feet had made the decision independently, following some magnetic pull while his conscious mind attended to the complex business of remaining upright.
Felix's office occupied the third floor, northwest corner. The windows would show light if—but what day was this? The examination committee had convened on Thursday. Or had that been Tuesday? Time had become a viscous substance, flowing backward and forward without regard for calendar logic.
Pass by. The command formed clearly in his mind, a directive as precise as any laboratory protocol. His legs received the instruction, processed it, and continued their steady progression toward the building's entrance.
The steps. Three of them, worn smooth by generations of architectural students. Emil gripped the iron railing and hauled himself upward. His body had developed the curious weight of wet cloth, heavy and liable to fold.
Inside, the vestibule smelled of chalk dust and linseed oil. The porter's lodge stood empty—what hour was it? Late afternoon? Evening? The quality of light gave no reliable information, filtered as it was through his unreliable perception.
He should leave. Now. Before anyone witnessed this unraveling.
His hand found the bannister of the main staircase.
The ascent required a recalibration of effort. Each step demanded its own negotiation, a careful placement of foot, shift of weight, lift of the trailing leg. By the first landing, a fine perspiration had broken across his forehead despite the building's chill.
Would Felix even be here? The man kept irregular hours, prone to vanishing into archives or construction sites without warning. Emil might climb these stairs—twenty-four to each floor, he had counted them once during a more capable moment—only to find a locked door, an empty office, no rescue from this voluntary ordeal.
Rescue. The word surfaced in his mind with its full weight of implication. He was not seeking rescue. He was simply—what? Resting? Paying a professional call at an hour he could not precisely identify?
Second floor. His knees had developed an alarming tendency to buckle without warning. The bannister bore more of his weight now, the wood polished by his grip. Below, footsteps echoed in the vestibule. Someone entering or leaving, their movement confident and purposeful in ways his own no longer was.
The third-floor hallway stretched before him, a tunnel of closed doors and fading light. Felix's office stood at the far end, might as well have been in another city for the distance it represented.
Emil began the journey, one hand trailing along the wall. The plaster felt granular beneath his fingers, as though he could read the building's history in its surface irregularities. Door after door passed: Dr. Mencl, Professor Schulz, the empty office that had belonged to someone whose name Emil could not presently recall.
Light showed beneath Felix's door. A thin gold line, delicate as an illuminated manuscript's decoration.
Turn around. The thought arrived with perfect clarity. He could descend those stairs, exit into the evening, continue the journey home. His body would obey if properly commanded. This was merely a question of will, and will was a muscle that could be exercised like any other.
His hand lifted, formed a fist, knocked.
The sound seemed to originate from very far away, as though someone else entirely had made the decision to announce their presence. Emil listened to it echo in the empty hallway, watched it ripple outward like stones dropped in still water.

Movement within. Chair legs scraping against floor, footsteps approaching, the mechanical click of the lock turning. The door opened and Felix stood framed in lamplight, his shirt sleeves rolled to the elbows, a pencil still held in one hand.
"Emil?" The name carried a question that multiplied as Felix's gaze traveled from Emil's face to his death-grip on the doorframe. "Good God."
Emil attempted to arrange his features into something approximating normalcy. "I was passing. Thought I might—" The sentence dissolved. He had forgotten what he might do.
Felix's hand was suddenly at his elbow, guiding him inside with a pressure both gentle and inexorable. The office smelled of paper and india ink, of coffee gone cold in its cup. Emil let himself be steered to a chair, noting with distant interest how Felix's fingers wrapped entirely around his upper arm.
"When did you last eat?"
The question required calculation. This morning? Yesterday? The days had begun to dissolve at their edges, the pigments of one bleeding softly into the next. "The examination committee," Emil began, then lost the thread of his own explanation.
Felix knelt before the chair, his face level with Emil's. This close, Emil could see the pencil smudge on his left cuff, the faint lines concern had etched around his eyes. "Emil. Look at me. When?"
The black spots had not dispersed. If anything, they had multiplied, dark flowers opening themselves across his visual field. Emil blinked hard, trying to clear them. The effort sent the room spinning on a new axis.
"Yesterday," he managed. Then, with more honesty than he had intended: "Perhaps."
Felix's expression underwent a transformation Emil could not fully track—shock, anger, something else that might have been fear. He rose in one fluid motion and moved to his desk, pulling open drawers with sharp efficiency.
"Don't—" Emil began, but Felix was already unwrapping something, breaking what appeared to be chocolate into pieces.
"Eat this. Now." The tone brooked no argument, carried an authority Emil had never heard from him before.
The chocolate was pressed into Emil's hand. His fingers closed around it automatically, but the coordination required to bring it to his mouth seemed impossibly complex. His hand shook with such violence that the chocolate rattled against his teeth.
Felix's hand covered his, steadying it. "Slowly."
The sweetness hit like a physical blow. Emil's stomach, so long empty, cramped immediately in protest. He must have made some sound, because Felix's other hand came to rest on his shoulder, anchoring him.
"Small bites. Just let it dissolve."
The black spots pulsed in time with his heartbeat. Emil focused on the pressure of Felix's hands, the solid reality of touch in a world gone uncertain at its edges. The chocolate melted on his tongue, too sweet, too rich, too much and not nearly enough.
"How long have you been walking?" Felix's voice came from very close. He had drawn up another chair, Emil realized, was sitting knee to knee with him.
"The committee finished at three." Or had it been four? Time had become negotiable.
"It's past seven."
Seven. The number held no particular meaning. Emil took another piece of chocolate, his hand steadier now, though the tremor ran deeper, through muscle and bone.
"You're going to make yourself properly ill." Felix's voice carried a curious roughness. "Do you understand that? This is—Christ, Emil, I can count your vertebrae through your jacket."
Emil wanted to protest that this was an exaggeration, that Felix could not possibly see through wool and cotton to the architecture beneath. But the words required assembly, and his mind had turned to other concerns. The chocolate had awakened his stomach from its resigned dormancy. It twisted now with a hunger so acute it resembled pain.
"We need to get some proper food into you." Felix was moving again, gathering papers from his desk, extinguishing the lamp. "Can you stand?"
It was a reasonable question. Emil considered his legs, those distant appendages that had carried him this far through will alone. They seemed disinclined to further effort.
"Of course," he said, and proved himself a liar by swaying dangerously the moment he attempted to rise.
Felix caught him. There was nothing delicate about it—his arm went around Emil's waist with the practical efficiency of someone preventing a fall. This close, Emil could smell the sandalwood soap Felix favored, could feel the solid warmth of him through multiple layers of cloth.
"My lodgings aren't far," Felix said. "We'll get a proper meal into you there."
Emil wanted to protest. He had a vague sense that this represented some crossing of boundaries, some admission of incapacity that could not be taken back. But the night flowers were blooming larger now, dark drooping petals smudging away the contours of the mapped world of his vision.

---
Emil's steps stuttered and his feet failed him twice on the way to the gates of the university. The first (Emil did not count the failed attempt at rising that made him sink back down to his chair and which caused Felix to silently hand him another piece of chocolate and watch while he let it dissolve in his mouth) occurred nearing the stairs at the landing. A peculiar sense that he were doing a cartwheel in some thick unctuous chemical overcame him, perhaps triggered by the strange perspective of the stairs. Emil thought he really ought to be alarmed about this, but as the dark flowers wilted in their beautiful death throes across his vision, he couldn't find the attention to care.
---
The landing materialized beneath his feet with dreamlike suddenness. Emil had been walking (he was certain of this) and then the floor tilted on an axis that existed somewhere behind his eyes. The sensation of rotation was extraordinary, as though he were suspended in glycerin, turning with infinite slowness while the world blurred past. It gave him the peculiar sense that he were doing a cartwheel in some thick unctuous chemical. Emil thought he really ought to be alarmed about this, but as the dark flowers wilted in their beautiful death throes across his vision, he couldn't find the attention to care.
His knees folded abruptly, staggering him.
Felix's arm tightened around his waist, taking his full weight without comment. The wall appeared under Emil's palm—when had he reached for it?—cold plaster against his overheated skin. The dark flowers bloomed larger, their petals unfurling with exquisite deliberation until they consumed whole portions of his visual field.
"All right." Felix's voice arrived from some great distance, filtered through the peculiar thickness that had invaded Emil's hearing. "We'll take a moment."
A moment. Yes. Emil concentrated on the wall beneath his hand, its solidity a fixed point in a universe gone liquid. His legs had become theoretical constructs, present in concept but absent in function.
"Can you hear me?" Felix's face swam into view, too close, multiplying briefly into two before resolving back to one.
Emil nodded. The motion set off a new wave of vertigo, the staircase below them spiraling into infinite recession like an architectural drawing gone mad.
Another piece of chocolate appeared before him. Felix's fingers were very steady as they pressed it between Emil's lips. The sweetness cut through the fog, sharp as ammonia, dragging him back toward coherence.
"We're going to take the stairs slowly," Felix said. His tone suggested this was not a topic for debate. "You're going to hold the bannister with your right hand and lean on me with your left. Understood?"
The plan seemed reasonable in theory. In practice, the stairs possessed a disturbing fluidity, each step swimming up to meet his feet at unexpected angles. Emil gripped the bannister hard enough to leave impressions in the wood, Felix's shoulder solid beneath his other hand.
Halfway down, the second episode struck.
This time the world simply slid sideways, as though someone had tilted the entire building fifteen degrees. Emil's foot missed the step entirely, plunging into empty air. Only Felix's grip prevented him from following it, from tumbling down the remaining stairs in a graceless collection of angles and momentum.
"I've got you." Felix had somehow shifted to take more of his weight, practically carrying him now. "Just lean on me."
Emil wanted to protest this indignity, but his mouth had forgotten the shape of words. The dark flowers were dying now, wilting inward with a beauty that made his chest tight. Or perhaps that was merely the hunger, grown so vast it had developed its own gravitational pull.
They reached the ground floor through some miracle of persistence. The porter had returned to his lodge, looked up with alarm as they passed. Felix offered some explanation that Emil didn't catch, his voice steady and reassuring in ways that suggested long practice with crisis management.
The evening air struck like cold water. Emil gulped it, trying to clear the persistent fog from his thoughts. The courtyard stretched before them, impossibly vast, its cobblestones gleaming with moisture that might have been dew or ice or simply his vision playing tricks.
"The gates," he managed, the words thick in his mouth.
"Yes," Felix agreed. "We're nearly there."
Nearly there. Emil focused on this promise, on the rhythm of their awkward progress across the courtyard. One step, then another, Felix bearing what must have been half his weight without complaint. The fountain passed on their left, its water frozen in mid-cascade, caught between motion and stillness like Emil himself.
Students passed them in small groups, their chatter dying as they took in the scene. Emil felt their gazes like physical touches, knew how this must appear—Professor Králik being all but carried by his colleague, his face grey as old paper, his body failing in ways that anyone could see.
He should care about this. His reputation, his position, the careful facade he had maintained for so long. But the dark flowers were dying down to their rotten roots, and he could only concentrate on the next step, the next breath, the solid warmth of Felix beside him in the falling dark.
