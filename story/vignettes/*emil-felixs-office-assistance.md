The examination committee had convened at half past ten. Now the clock's hands approached three, and the carved faces on the committee room's wainscoting seemed to shift in Emil's peripheral vision, their wooden mouths opening and closing in silent repetition.
Someone had ordered refreshments.
The porter arranged them on the sideboard with methodical precision: sliced meats glistening with their own oils, wheels of cheese releasing their sharp perfume into the closed air, fresh rolls still bearing warmth from the baker's ovens. The smell infiltrated everything—the papers before him, the wool of his sleeve, the very molecules of air he was forced to breathe.
Emil pressed his right hand flat against his thigh beneath the table. The tremor had begun an hour ago, a fine vibration like a tuning fork struck and left to sing. His left hand gripped the pen with excessive force, the knuckles white as exposed bone.
"Dr. Králik, your assessment of the candidate's methodology?"
The words floated across the vast distance of the table. Professor Weber's face appeared to recede and advance by turns, as though viewed through a telescope someone was adjusting. Emil heard his own voice emerge, surprisingly steady: "The experimental design shows promise, though the controls require refinement."
His stomach had ceased its protests hours ago. Now it existed as a hollow carved into his center, a void that pulled at the edges of his vision. The room's gas fixtures bloomed with halos.
Dr. Novotny was eating. The man had helped himself to the refreshments during the last recess, and crumbs still clung to his beard. Each time he spoke, they danced. Emil found himself counting them. Seven. Now six. The lost crumb had fallen to the paper before Novotny, a tiny planet on the white expanse.
"Gentlemen, shall we break for refreshment?" The committee chair's suggestion rippled through the room.
Emil's hand jerked involuntarily toward the table edge. He converted the motion into a gesture of checking his watch. "I believe we're near conclusion. Perhaps we might finish?"
But already the others were rising, moving toward the sideboard with the inexorable purpose of men who had lunched lightly in anticipation of the committee's hospitality. Emil remained seated, shuffling papers with elaborate attention.
The smell intensified. Butter. Salt. The yeast-sweet interior of fresh bread. Someone had sliced a roll in half, and Emil could see the steam rising from its opened heart, delicate as souls ascending.
He stood. The room tilted.
"Are you well, Králik?" Weber materialized at his elbow, solid and concerned.
"Perfectly." Emil gripped the table edge. The wood felt soft beneath his fingers, as though he might leave impressions like a medieval saint. "The close air. Perhaps I'll step onto the balcony."
He moved toward the French doors with careful steps. Each placement of foot required consideration. The parquet floor had developed a concerning elasticity, giving slightly beneath his weight like flesh.
On the balcony, the November air struck like a slap. Good. The cold sharpened the edges of things, brought the university courtyard back into proper focus. Below, students crossed between buildings, their forms dark and definite against the frost-white ground.
His hands shook freely now, hidden in his pockets. The tremor had spread upward, a subtle electricity running beneath his skin. Inside, laughter erupted—someone had made a jest about the candidate's German grammar. The sound carried a physical weight, pressing against Emil's skull.
When he turned back to the doors, Felix stood on the other side of the glass.
Not truly Felix—Emil knew this even as his hunger-loosened mind supplied the details with hallucinatory precision. Felix wasn't on the examination committee. But there he stood regardless, holding a plate of food with that particular gesture of casual grace, speaking to Weber while his free hand sketched shapes in the air.
Emil blinked hard. The figure resolved into Dr. Procházka, stout and bearded and nothing like Felix at all.
Inside, the committee reassembled. Emil navigated back to his seat, noting how the other men's faces had taken on a satisfied sheen. Plates dotted the table now, casualties of academic appetite. A slice of ham lay abandoned inches from Emil's papers, its edges curling.
"Now then, the matter of publication requirements." The chair's voice seemed to originate from very far away, or perhaps from inside Emil's own skull.
Emil's pen moved across paper, recording opinions and objections. The words appeared in his own hand, properly formed, though he had no memory of writing them. His vision had developed a curious quality, as though he were looking up through water at the wavering surface world above.
Time dilated. Contracted. The committee members' mouths moved in elaborate patterns that might have been speech or might have been chewing or might have been the complex motions of some marine creatures he had once seen preserved in glass jars.
"...conclude this portion of the examination," someone said.
Emil heard himself agreeing to something. Papers rustled. Chairs scraped. The other men were standing, and so Emil stood too, his hand finding the table edge with the instinct of a blind creature.
"Excellent work today, gentlemen." The chair's satisfaction radiated like heat. "The final determination on Monday, then?"
Agreement rippled through the room. Emil nodded with the rest, though Monday existed in some impossible future beyond the immediate necessity of remaining upright.
The hallway stretched before him, a tunnel of dark wood and intermittent gas lamps. He moved through it with deliberate calm, each step a small victory over the peculiar weightlessness that threatened to carry him up toward the vaulted ceiling.
In his office, Emil locked the door and sank into his desk chair. The room spun gently, a carousel viewed from its center. On his desk, his morning coffee cup sat exactly where he had left it, a brown ring dried in its bottom like a fossil record of appetite refused.
His hands, when he held them before his face, shook with the rapid tremor of hummingbird wings.

Abstractly, as if such things were purely hypothetical, Emil considered the situation. 

The problem presented itself as a geometric equation. His office to the building entrance: forty-seven steps down the main corridor, a right turn, twenty-three steps to the heavy doors. Then the courtyard, its diagonal path offering the shortest route but requiring navigation around the fountain. After that, the gates, the street, the series of turns and straightaways that comprised his usual route home.
Emil regarded his hands with scientific interest. They had ceased their trembling and adopted a curious lassitude, as though the bones had been replaced with some more flexible material. When he attempted to make a fist, the fingers responded with notable delay, closing in sequence like a slow-motion study of muscular action.
The chair held him with unexpected tenacity. Rising would require a coordinated effort between multiple muscle groups, a symphony of neural signals and mechanical responses that seemed, at present, beyond his conducting abilities.
He might remain here. The office had a perfectly serviceable chair. The door was locked. In the morning—but no, the morning brought lectures, students, the elaborate performance of professorial competence.
Walking. He had walked extraordinary distances under worse conditions. The body, properly directed, could achieve remarkable feats through will alone. This was simply a matter of breaking the journey into manageable segments.
First, standing.
He gripped the desk edge and hauled himself upward. His legs performed their function, though they seemed to belong to someone else, some distant acquaintance whose movements he was observing with polite interest. The room swayed, steadied, swayed again in a rhythm that might have been his pulse or the building settling or the earth itself rotating on its axis.
The door. Key in lock. The mechanical action required three attempts, his fingers refusing the delicate coordination necessary for such precise work. But then—success. The hallway opened before him, blessedly empty of colleagues who might note his careful progress along the wall.
Forty-seven steps. He counted them with the attention of a naturalist recording specimens. Each footfall required individual consideration, placement, weight transfer. His body had become a fascinating puzzle, its operations no longer automatic but demanding conscious oversight.
The main doors loomed with their brass fixtures and weight. He would need momentum. Emil stepped back, gathered what resources remained, and pushed forward. The door yielded, and he emerged into the courtyard's grey light like some deep-sea creature breaking the surface.
The fountain. He had not accounted for the thin layer of ice that glazed the cobblestones around it. His foot skidded, and for a moment he existed in pure suspension, neither falling nor standing, occupying some liminal space between states.
His hand found the fountain's edge. The stone was cold enough to burn through his glove, shocking his nerves back into temporary cooperation. He stood still, breathing the sharp air, watching students pass in their dark coats like figures in a diorama.
The journey home stretched before him, a map drawn in uncertain ink. He might take a carriage—but that would require hailing one, explaining his destination, managing the step up into the conveyance. These actions seemed to require more coordination than his current reserves allowed.
Walking, then. One foot before the other, that ancient human rhythm. He had once calculated the exact number of steps from university to lodgings: one thousand three hundred and sixty-two. A finite number. Achievable.
Emil released the fountain and began.

The architectural building materialized on his right, its sandstone facade the color of old bone in the failing light. Emil had not intended to take this route. His feet had made the decision independently, following some magnetic pull while his conscious mind attended to the complex business of remaining upright.
Felix's office occupied the third floor, northwest corner. The windows would show light if—but what day was this? The examination committee had convened on Thursday. Or had that been Tuesday? Time had become a viscous substance, flowing backward and forward without regard for calendar logic.
Pass by. The command formed clearly in his mind, a directive as precise as any laboratory protocol. His legs received the instruction, processed it, and continued their steady progression toward the building's entrance.
The steps. Three of them, worn smooth by generations of architectural students. Emil gripped the iron railing and hauled himself upward. His body had developed the curious weight of wet cloth, heavy and liable to fold.
Inside, the vestibule smelled of chalk dust and linseed oil. The porter's lodge stood empty—what hour was it? Late afternoon? Evening? The quality of light gave no reliable information, filtered as it was through his unreliable perception.
He should leave. Now. Before anyone witnessed this unraveling.
His hand found the bannister of the main staircase.
The ascent required a recalibration of effort. Each step demanded its own negotiation, a careful placement of foot, shift of weight, lift of the trailing leg. By the first landing, a fine perspiration had broken across his forehead despite the building's chill.
Would Felix even be here? The man kept irregular hours, prone to vanishing into archives or construction sites without warning. Emil might climb these stairs—twenty-four to each floor, he had counted them once during a more capable moment—only to find a locked door, an empty office, no rescue from this voluntary ordeal.
Rescue. The word surfaced in his mind with its full weight of implication. He was not seeking rescue. He was simply—what? Resting? Paying a professional call at an hour he could not precisely identify?
Second floor. His knees had developed an alarming tendency to buckle without warning. The bannister bore more of his weight now, the wood polished by his grip. Below, footsteps echoed in the vestibule. Someone entering or leaving, their movement confident and purposeful in ways his own no longer was.
The third-floor hallway stretched before him, a tunnel of closed doors and fading light. Felix's office stood at the far end, might as well have been in another city for the distance it represented.
Emil began the journey, one hand trailing along the wall. The plaster felt granular beneath his fingers, as though he could read the building's history in its surface irregularities. Door after door passed: Dr. Mencl, Professor Schulz, the empty office that had belonged to someone whose name Emil could not presently recall.
Light showed beneath Felix's door. A thin gold line, delicate as an illuminated manuscript's decoration.
Turn around. The thought arrived with perfect clarity. He could descend those stairs, exit into the evening, continue the journey home. His body would obey if properly commanded. This was merely a question of will, and will was a muscle that could be exercised like any other.
His hand lifted, formed a fist, knocked.
The sound seemed to originate from very far away, as though someone else entirely had made the decision to announce their presence. Emil listened to it echo in the empty hallway, watched it ripple outward like stones dropped in still water.

Movement within. Chair legs scraping against floor, footsteps approaching, the mechanical click of the lock turning. The door opened and Felix stood framed in lamplight, his shirt sleeves rolled to the elbows, a pencil still held in one hand.
"Emil?" The name carried a question that multiplied as Felix's gaze traveled from Emil's face to his death-grip on the doorframe. "Good God."
Emil attempted to arrange his features into something approximating normalcy. "I was passing. Thought I might—" The sentence dissolved. He had forgotten what he might do.
Felix's hand was suddenly at his elbow, guiding him inside with a pressure both gentle and inexorable. The office smelled of paper and india ink, of coffee gone cold in its cup. Emil let himself be steered to a chair, noting with distant interest how Felix's fingers wrapped entirely around his upper arm.
"When did you last eat?"
The question required calculation. This morning? Yesterday? The days had begun to dissolve at their edges, the pigments of one bleeding softly into the next. "The examination committee," Emil began, then lost the thread of his own explanation.
Felix knelt before the chair, his face level with Emil's. This close, Emil could see the pencil smudge on his left cuff, the faint lines concern had etched around his eyes. "Emil. Look at me. When?"
The black spots had not dispersed. If anything, they had multiplied, dark flowers opening themselves across his visual field. Emil blinked hard, trying to clear them. The effort sent the room spinning on a new axis.
"Yesterday," he managed. Then, with more honesty than he had intended: "Perhaps."
Felix's expression underwent a transformation Emil could not fully track—shock, anger, something else that might have been fear. He rose in one fluid motion and moved to his desk, pulling open drawers with sharp efficiency.
"Don't—" Emil began, but Felix was already unwrapping something, breaking what appeared to be chocolate into pieces.
"Eat this. Now." The tone brooked no argument, carried an authority Emil had never heard from him before.
The chocolate was pressed into Emil's hand. His fingers closed around it automatically, but the coordination required to bring it to his mouth seemed impossibly complex. His hand shook with such violence that the chocolate rattled against his teeth.
Felix's hand covered his, steadying it. "Slowly."
The sweetness hit like a physical blow. Emil's stomach, so long empty, cramped immediately in protest. He must have made some sound, because Felix's other hand came to rest on his shoulder, anchoring him.
"Small bites. Just let it dissolve."
The black spots pulsed in time with his heartbeat. Emil focused on the pressure of Felix's hands, the solid reality of touch in a world gone uncertain at its edges. The chocolate melted on his tongue, too sweet, too rich, too much and not nearly enough.
"How long have you been walking?" Felix's voice came from very close. He had drawn up another chair, Emil realized, was sitting knee to knee with him.
"The committee finished at three." Or had it been four? Time had become negotiable.
"It's past seven."
Seven. The number held no particular meaning. Emil took another piece of chocolate, his hand steadier now, though the tremor ran deeper, through muscle and bone.
"You're going to make yourself properly ill." Felix's voice carried a curious roughness. "Do you understand that? This is—Christ, Emil, I can count your vertebrae through your jacket."
Emil wanted to protest that this was an exaggeration, that Felix could not possibly see through wool and cotton to the architecture beneath. But the words required assembly, and his mind had turned to other concerns. The chocolate had awakened his stomach from its resigned dormancy. It twisted now with a hunger so acute it resembled pain.
"We need to get some proper food into you." Felix was moving again, gathering papers from his desk, extinguishing the lamp. "Can you stand?"
It was a reasonable question. Emil considered his legs, those distant appendages that had carried him this far through will alone. They seemed disinclined to further effort.
"Of course," he said, and proved himself a liar by swaying dangerously the moment he attempted to rise.
Felix caught him. There was nothing delicate about it—his arm went around Emil's waist with the practical efficiency of someone preventing a fall. This close, Emil could smell the sandalwood soap Felix favored, could feel the solid warmth of him through multiple layers of cloth.
"My lodgings aren't far," Felix said. "We'll get a proper meal into you there."
Emil wanted to protest. He had a vague sense that this represented some crossing of boundaries, some admission of incapacity that could not be taken back. But the night flowers were blooming larger now, dark drooping petals smudging away the contours of the mapped world of his vision.


The landing materialized beneath his feet with dreamlike suddenness. Emil had been walking (he was certain of this) and then the floor tilted on an axis that existed somewhere behind his eyes. The sensation of rotation was extraordinary, as though he were suspended in glycerin, turning with infinite slowness while the world blurred past. It gave him the peculiar sense that he were doing a cartwheel in some thick unctuous chemical. Emil thought he really ought to be alarmed about this, but as the dark flowers wilted in their beautiful death throes across his vision, he couldn't find the attention to care.
His knees folded abruptly, staggering him.
Felix's arm tightened around his waist, taking his full weight without comment. The wall appeared under Emil's palm—when had he reached for it?—cold plaster against his overheated skin. The dark flowers bloomed larger, their petals unfurling with exquisite deliberation until they consumed whole portions of his visual field.
"All right." Felix's voice arrived from some great distance, filtered through the peculiar thickness that had invaded Emil's hearing. "We'll take a moment."
A moment. Yes. Emil concentrated on the wall beneath his hand, its solidity a fixed point in a universe gone liquid. His legs had become theoretical constructs, present in concept but absent in function.
"Can you hear me?" Felix's face swam into view, too close, multiplying briefly into two before resolving back to one.
Emil nodded. The motion set off a new wave of vertigo, the staircase below them spiraling into infinite recession like an architectural drawing gone mad.
Another piece of chocolate appeared before him. Felix's fingers were very steady as they pressed it between Emil's lips. The sweetness cut through the fog, sharp as ammonia, dragging him back toward coherence.
"We're going to take the stairs slowly," Felix said. His tone suggested this was not a topic for debate. "You're going to hold the bannister with your right hand and lean on me with your left. Understood?"
The plan seemed reasonable in theory. In practice, the stairs possessed a disturbing fluidity, each step swimming up to meet his feet at unexpected angles. Emil gripped the bannister hard enough to leave impressions in the wood, Felix's shoulder solid beneath his other hand.
Halfway down, the second episode struck.
This time the world simply slid sideways, as though someone had tilted the entire building fifteen degrees. Emil's foot missed the step entirely, plunging into empty air. Only Felix's grip prevented him from following it, from tumbling down the remaining stairs in a graceless collection of angles and momentum.
"I've got you." Felix had somehow shifted to take more of his weight, practically carrying him now. "Just lean on me."
Emil wanted to protest this indignity, but his mouth had forgotten the shape of words. The dark flowers were dying now, wilting inward with a beauty that made his chest tight. Or perhaps that was merely the hunger, grown so vast it had developed its own gravitational pull.
They reached the ground floor through some miracle of persistence. The porter had returned to his lodge, looked up with alarm as they passed. Felix offered some explanation that Emil didn't catch, his voice steady and reassuring in ways that suggested long practice with crisis management.
The evening air struck like cold water. Emil gulped it, trying to clear the persistent fog from his thoughts. The courtyard stretched before them, impossibly vast, its cobblestones gleaming with moisture that might have been dew or ice or simply his vision playing tricks.
"The gates," he managed, the words thick in his mouth.
"Yes," Felix agreed. "We're nearly there."
Nearly there. Emil focused on this promise, on the rhythm of their awkward progress across the courtyard. One step, then another, Felix bearing what must have been half his weight without complaint. The fountain passed on their left, its water frozen in mid-cascade, caught between motion and stillness like Emil himself.
Students passed them in small groups, their chatter dying as they took in the scene. Emil felt their gazes like physical touches, knew how this must appear—Professor Králik being all but carried by his colleague, his face grey as old paper, his body failing in ways that anyone could see.
He should care about this. His reputation, his position, the careful facade he had maintained for so long. But the dark flowers were dying down to their rotten roots, and he could only concentrate on the next step, the next breath, the solid warmth of Felix beside him in the falling dark. 

But the dark flowers were dying down to their rotten roots. 

The pain arrived with surgical precision, as though someone had threaded a needle between his ribs and begun embroidering his cardiac muscle with quick, vicious stitches. Emil's hand went to his chest, fingers splaying across his waistcoat in search of the external wound that must surely accompany such internal violence.
"What is it?" Felix's voice, sharp now with genuine alarm.
Emil couldn't answer. The vegetation—for that's what it felt like, some thorned vine taking root in the chambers of his heart—twisted with each beat. His pulse had become visible, he was certain, jumping beneath the thin skin of his throat like something desperate to escape.
They had nearly reached the gates. So close. But his heart had developed its own agenda, stuttering and racing in patterns that belonged in no medical text he'd studied. The chocolate, perhaps—the sudden sugar after such prolonged denial. His body no longer knew what to do with sweetness except treat it as poison.
"We need to stop." Felix was already guiding him to the low wall that bordered the path. "Sit. Now."
The stone was cold through his trousers. Emil bent forward, trying to ease the stabbing sensation, but the movement only shifted the pain to new locations. The vegetation had spread, thorns catching in his lungs, making each breath a careful negotiation.
"Is it your heart?" Felix's hand was at his wrist, fingers finding his pulse with surprising competence. "Your heart rate is—Christ."
Emil knew. Could feel the hummingbird flutter, too fast, too light, occasionally skipping beats entirely as though his heart were attempting morse code. The dark flowers had withered away, but in their place came this new torment, sharp and immediate and impossible to ignore.
"It will pass," he managed, though he had no evidence for this assertion.
Felix's hand moved to his back, rubbing circles that might have been soothing if Emil could feel anything beyond the war being waged in his chest cavity. "We should get you to the medical faculty. There's always someone—"
"No." The word came out with more force than Emil had thought possible. To be examined by colleagues, to have his condition documented, discussed, diagnosed—better to die here on this wall than submit to that particular humiliation.
The vegetation twisted again, sending shoots down into his stomach, up into his throat. His mouth flooded with saliva, the precursor to nausea that would bring up the chocolate, the only sustenance he'd managed in—how long?
He swallowed hard, willing his body to retain what little it had been given. The effort sent new thorns spreading across his chest, a lattice of pain that made breathing an act of will rather than instinct.
"Emil." Felix's voice had dropped to something quiet and urgent. "I need you to try to slow your breathing. You're hyperventilating."
Was he? Emil attempted to focus on his respiration, found it had indeed become rapid and shallow, each inhalation catching on the thorns. He tried to deepen it, to draw air down into his lungs properly, but the vegetation had claimed that territory, making expansion impossible.
The gates loomed before them, iron bars that seemed to pulse in time with his erratic heartbeat. Beyond them, the street, the journey to Felix's lodgings, the impossibility of food when his body was already rejecting the mere suggestion of nourishment.
"I can't," he heard himself say, though whether he meant breathe or walk or continue this pretense of functionality, he couldn't determine.
Felix's arm tightened around him. "You can. We're going to stand up—slowly—and make it through those gates. Then we'll find a carriage. No more walking tonight."
A carriage. The thought of enclosed space, of movement beyond his control, sent the vegetation into new growth. But Felix was already helping him rise, taking so much of his weight that Emil's feet barely needed to touch the ground.
The world narrowed to essential elements: Felix's shoulder beneath his hand, the cobblestones passing beneath his feet, the gates growing larger with each step. The vegetation continued its vicious cultivation, but Emil found he could coexist with it, could move despite the thorns, despite the way his heart seemed determined to escape through his throat.
They passed through the gates. The street beyond was blessedly quiet, gaslight casting pools of yellow that looked almost warm enough to collapse into. Felix's hand was already rising to hail a passing carriage, his voice calling out the address with an authority that suggested he would accept no refusal.
The vegetation pulsed, twisted, sent out new shoots. But they were moving now, and motion was progress, and progress meant survival, even if survival felt very much like dying in exceptionally slow motion.

Felix was very much like a pier to which Emil had anchored his little boat. While the world swirled in eddying tides, the carriage, time, his own blessed blood, Felix remained solid, immovable, not allowing Emil to be swept away. The dying roses had wilted enough that their spines had a touch of rot, a bit of slip, enough to cause pressure without the piercing pulses. When they shed their finery in their last display of life, they didn't have the decency to sweep the petals away from his eyelids. With a strange laugh that Emil distantly witnessed bubble up from his own throat, he wondered if the boatman would take this as his payment. But he wasn't dying. A fluttering and weak mitral valve was merely vomiting his own blood back into his starving heart but that was no sustenance for it. And then they were stepping out, Emil's little boat dipping into the lock of a canal, bobbing along behind the tug of Felix's hand. And then his heart was not the only organ regurgitating, though in the darkness he wasn't sure if both fluids were blood. The little moon garden died as the silver globe was swept behind the clouds, it's pretty little purpose for living whisked away, and Emil let the faint carry him. Let the faint scent of jasmine and indoles and pretty pretty death bouquets ease him to the stones. 

The ceiling above him possessed an elaborate plaster rosette, its petals spiraling outward in mathematical precision. Emil studied it with the detachment of a man examining his own specimen jar, noting how the gaslight caught in its crevices, creating shadows that breathed with each flicker of the flame.
Click click click on wood. Shush shush shush on carpet. Felix's journey between window and door had worn a path in the air itself, visible as a disturbance in the golden light.
"Felix." The word emerged as barely more than breath, but it was enough to halt the pacing.
Felix materialized at the edge of his vision, then fully in view as he dropped to his knees beside—a sofa. Emil was on Felix's sofa, a blanket tucked around him with maternal precision. When had that happened? Time had developed gaps, like pages torn from a notebook.
"Thank God." Felix's hand went to Emil's forehead, checking for fever with the practiced gesture of someone who had tended illness before. "You've been—it's been twenty minutes."
Twenty minutes. Such a precise measurement for what had felt like both eternity and instant. Emil attempted to sit up, discovered his body had other plans, and subsided back into the cushions.
"Don't." Felix's hand pressed gently against his shoulder. "You collapsed completely. I had to—" A pause, color rising in his cheeks. "The stairs were a challenge."
Carried. Felix had carried him up the stairs like a bride or a corpse, dead weight in evening dress. The thought should have mortified him. Instead, Emil found himself studying the flush on Felix's face, the way exertion and worry had loosened his usually perfect hair.
"Your heart rate is still too fast." Felix's fingers had found his wrist again, that competent touch. "And you were sick. On the street."
Ah. The memory surfaced dimly—the carriage door opening, the pavement rushing up, his body's violent rejection of even the small sweetness it had been given. No wonder Felix looked at him with such barely controlled alarm.
"I should fetch a doctor." Felix was already half-rising.
"No." Emil managed to catch his sleeve, though the effort sent new thorns blooming through his chest. "Please. It will pass."
"Pass?" Felix's voice cracked slightly. "Emil, you—do you have any idea what you look like? What you feel like? There's nothing to you. You're disappearing."
The words hung between them, too honest for the careful dance they usually performed. Emil released Felix's sleeve, let his hand fall back to the blanket. His fingers looked strange against the wool, all tendon and bone, the architecture too visible beneath insufficient flesh.
"I need to get something into you." Felix stood abruptly, moving toward what must be his kitchen. "Broth. Something gentle."
Emil closed his eyes, listening to the sounds of domesticity—a pot clattering, water running, the strike of a match. The ordinary music of sustenance being prepared. His stomach twisted in anticipation and dread, uncertain which sensation would win.
When he opened his eyes again, Felix had drawn a chair close to the sofa. Steam rose from a cup in his hands, carrying the smell of chicken broth, simple and clean.
"Just a little," Felix said. "Slowly."
The cup was warm against Emil's lips. The first sip hit his empty stomach like a stone dropping into a well, sending ripples of sensation through his entire body. He waited for rebellion, for his body to reject even this gentle offering.
It stayed down.
"Good," Felix murmured. "That's good."
The second sip was easier. The third. Emil found himself greedily focused on the cup, on the warmth spreading through his chest that had nothing to do with thorns or dying flowers. Just heat, sustenance, the basic animal comfort of being fed.
"When did this get so bad?" Felix's question was quiet, addressed more to the cup than to Emil. "How did I not see?"
Emil could have offered explanations—the careful concealment, the practiced deceptions, the way he'd turned avoidance into art. Instead, he took another sip of broth and let the question dissolve between them, another page torn from the notebook of things that needed saying.
The pacing had stopped. Felix sat perfectly still now, watching Emil drink with an intensity that suggested he was memorizing the moment, filing it away with his architectural drawings and preserved details. Evidence of something that needed documenting before it disappeared entirely.

The warmth in his chest gently spread throughout his torso, the tides of his body rising to something approximating a navigable level. Not easy, but a level at which a competent riverman could maneuver. As Emil's body frantically began trying to utilize the soup before it too would be lost, his blood flow drained to his core. Emil watched dreamily at the growing cyanosis of his nail beds and fingertips. A human cyanotype. What sort of image is he developing? What optical impressions is he casting behind the shuttered gaze of Felix's eyes? 

"Emil." Felix took his hand and smoothed his own fingertips over Emil's. Emil's breath was caught between a gasp and a sigh. Somehow this was the prettiest sight he could imagine. And how he had imagined. He let himself believe that it was permitted to inhabit his body at this moment. That this was permitted. Gave himself permission to enjoy the feel of Felix's fingertips. Gave permission to wish for more. 

Felix squeezed his limp hand gently. Had he lost time again? "Emil, you need to tell me if this is medically significant." He smoothed his fingers across the blue tips of Emil's digits. 

Ah. Of course. No more than the way Emil himself would touch a patient. Diagnostic. Patient yes, even with care, but not - Emil cut the thought off before it could metastisize. 

"Cyanosis. Blood flow is required to facilitate digestion. Poor oxygenation and low blood volume. Combined with caloric shock. A normal physiological response." 

Wakefulness was so hard.

"Normal." Felix's voice carried an edge Emil couldn't quite identify. "Nothing about this is normal."

The fingers continued their path across Emil's knuckles, mapping the territory where blue gave way to white. Felix's touch was methodical, yes, but there was a tremor in it, barely perceptible, like a tuning fork struck at too high a frequency to properly hear.

"Your medical knowledge." Felix's thumb pressed gently against Emil's wrist, finding the pulse point. "Does it help? Knowing exactly how you're dying?"

The question hung in the air between them. Emil watched his own hand in Felix's grasp, noting how the lamplight caught on the fine bones, the way the blue seemed to deepen where the shadows fell. A study in anatomical architecture.

"Not dying." The words took enormous effort. "Merely redistributing resources."

Felix made a sound that might have been a laugh if it hadn't been so raw. His other hand came to cover Emil's, trapping it between his palms. Warmth, impossible warmth, seeping into Emil's cyanotic fingers.

"Your resources are insufficient for redistribution." Felix's head was bent, studying their joined hands with the focus he usually reserved for architectural details. "You're running deficits on deficits."

Emil wanted to protest, to offer some clinical justification, but his thoughts had gone soft at the edges. The broth continued its work in his stomach, demanding energy he didn't possess, blood flow he couldn't spare. His vision began to tunnel again, but gently this time, like looking through a camera lens slowly narrowing its aperture.

"Stay awake." Felix's grip tightened. "Please. Just—stay with me a little longer."

With you. The words sparked something in Emil's chest that had nothing to do with thorns or dying flowers. He forced his eyes to focus on Felix's face, on the particular way worry had reorganized his features. When had Felix become so essential to the continuation of his pulse?

"I'm here," Emil managed, though where 'here' was remained negotiable. His body felt distributed between multiple locations—his core burning with digestive effort, his extremities floating in some distant blue country, his consciousness tethered only by the anchor of Felix's hands.

Felix lifted Emil's hand, brought it closer to the lamp. The blue had deepened to something almost beautiful, like stained glass in a cathedral window. "How long before circulation returns?"

"Twenty minutes. Perhaps thirty." Each word was a weight to be lifted. "Dependent on multiple variables."

"Then we wait." Felix shifted his chair closer, maintaining his grip on Emil's hand. "And you'll drink more broth when your body permits. And we'll repeat this process until you can maintain your own temperature."

The plan sounded impossibly optimistic. Emil's body had forgotten how to process kindness, how to accept sustenance without rebellion. But Felix's hands were warm, and the lamp cast golden light across the ceiling rosette, and perhaps this moment could stretch just a little longer.

"You're shaking." Emil observed, the realization arriving delayed.

Felix's laugh was barely breath. "Yes, well. Carrying unconscious colleagues up three flights of stairs will do that."

Or fear. Emil could see it now, the fine tremor in Felix's shoulders, the way his jaw was set against some emotion that threatened to spill over. Felix, who moved through the world with such easy grace, reduced to this barely controlled trembling.

"I'm sorry," Emil whispered.

"Don't." Felix's voice went rough. "Don't apologize. Just—don't do this again. Whatever this is, whatever you're trying to prove or punish or—" He stopped, swallowed. "Just don't."

Emil wanted to promise, wanted to offer reassurance, but his tongue had grown heavy and his thoughts were scattering like light through a prism. The blue in his fingers pulsed with his heartbeat, a visible tide ebbing and flowing. Felix's hands remained steady despite their tremor, holding him to this moment, this room, this unbearable tenderness that hurt worse than any thorn.

"Whatever you're trying to prove or punish." The thought rolled around in the empty field of Emil's mind. Whatever you're trying to prove or punish. 
Was it very difficult, Emil wondered, for Felix to carry him? He cast his mind back to the measurements and numbers from this morning (was it only this morning that it has been that he had last checked?). Recalled the number. Almost. It was almost satisfactory. He laid it down inside his skull next to Felix's words. The substrate was warped and flawed and the two circled and moved, pendulous and uncertain on their own trajectories. 

Whatever you're trying to punish or prove. What did Emil's hand feel like clasped between Felix's own? Did the fine hand bones trace their little ridges against his palm? Were the distal joints, wider than the fingers themselves, little pearls against his grasp? Or were they still soft, unpleasant. Emil tried to recall the last time Felix had sketched Emil's hands, tried to see, as he always did, what they looked like through his friend's eyes. But that was undefinable, there was no small orb of glass to add to the floor of his mind. Instead he scrutinized a little foggy cracked marble and wondered, wondered, wondered and feared if it was very difficult for Felix to carry him up the stairs.

The weight of a grown man reduced to—what had the number been? The digits swam away each time he reached for them, slippery as mercury, leaving only the sense of almost. Almost there. Almost acceptable. Almost light enough to justify the cruel mathematics of subtraction he'd been performing on himself.

Felix's thumb moved across his knuckles in a rhythm that might have been unconscious. Emil studied the motion with the detached fascination of watching a clock's mechanism, each sweep marking time he couldn't quite track. The blue in his fingers had begun to fade at the edges, pink creeping back like dawn at the horizon.

Difficult. The word lodged in his throat. Had it been difficult? Felix was stronger than he appeared—all that climbing through construction sites, all those hours spent documenting buildings that required physical navigation. But strength was relative, and Emil had made himself into something that barely registered on any scale.

He thought of the sketches. Felix's drawings scattered across tables, tucked into notebooks, pinned to walls. How many featured Emil's hands? He'd caught glimpses—quick studies of fingers holding a pen, gestures captured mid-explanation, the architecture of bone and tendon rendered in precise lines. But what did Felix see now? Not the hands of a colleague, surely. These blue-tipped appendages belonged to something else, something that required carrying up stairs like salvage from a shipwreck.

"You're thinking too loudly," Felix murmured. His own hands had steadied, the tremor subsiding into something more like contained energy. "I can practically hear the gears grinding."

Emil tried to form a response, but the words scattered before he could arrange them properly. Instead, he focused on the physical sensations—the returning warmth, the persistent ache in his chest where the thorns had been, the strange floating quality of his limbs as circulation grudgingly resumed its work.

The number surfaced suddenly, unbidden. He pushed it away before it could fully form, before it could offer its false comfort. Numbers were liars, every one of them, promising control while delivering only this—blue fingers in lamplight, Felix's haunted expression, the terrible softness in his voice when he'd said *don't*.

"It wasn't difficult," Felix said suddenly, as though responding to a question Emil hadn't voiced. "Carrying you. You asked—or you were thinking it. I could tell." A pause, weighted. "That's what frightens me. Not the weight of you, but the lack of it."

Emil closed his eyes. Behind his lids, the marbles continued their drunken paths across the warped wood of his thoughts. Felix's words joined them, rolling into corners, colliding with older fears, newer shames. Whatever you're trying to prove or punish.

Both, perhaps. Or neither. Or something else entirely, something that had no name beyond the relief of watching numbers fall, of feeling his body occupy less space, of achieving a kind of mathematics that made sense only in the privacy of his own calculations.

"Your color's returning," Felix observed. Professional distance creeping back into his voice, a safer register than the raw emotion of moments before. "Can you feel your fingers?"

Emil flexed them experimentally within Felix's grasp. Pins and needles, the predictable agony of returning sensation. "Yes."

"Good. We'll try more broth soon." Felix didn't release his hand, though the medical justification had passed. "And then something solid, when you can manage it."

The thought of solid food sent a wave of anticipatory nausea through Emil's body. But he kept his eyes closed, let Felix maintain his grip, let the marbles of his thoughts continue their chaotic dance. Time enough later to resist, to calculate, to return to the cruel arithmetic of denial.

For now, there was only this: the warmth returning to his fingers, the weight of Felix's hands around his, the terrible kindness of being held while his body remembered how to exist.

Later - he must have been asleep, for his state of wakefulness now was a contrast that implied it's opposite. Later, Emil finds Felix and his shadow standing over him. With his face turned towards Emil, the lamplight didn't illuminate his features, but cast his shadow looming up the wall. It was the natural law demonstrating Felix's fear, Emil fancied, still not quite himself, he realized. Felix. So quick to laugh, quick to smile. So quick to compliment that Emil had never entirely trusted it (had hated the man for what he had mistaken for mockery so many years ago). His even, constant friend, but now with a third phantom personage added to the room. How long has Fear been Felix's shadow? Weeks? Or had it only woke tonight, thrown by the terrible performance Emil's collapse had cast upon the wall? 

It must have been quite late indeed. Felix had removed his coat, his vest, his collar, his shoes. A deep blue dressing gown served a semblance of propriety. Emil vaguely wished it didn't. Pushed the thought back down that set on him like an eager dog. Whatever you're trying to punish or prove. A sigh, involuntary and too honest. 

"Did you hear me? I said you looked cold - you're shaking, look." Emil dropped his eyes reluctantly and saw that yes, fine tremors were making their determined migrations across his form. 

"So I am," Emil replied. 

"You will take my bed tonight," Felix declared with a set of his lips that he made when he had made up his mind, on those very rare occasions on which he would not be swayed. 

"The bed then," Emil agreed, too weary to construct proper resistance. He watched Felix move about the room with unusual efficiency, gathering the blanket from the sofa, disappearing into what must be the bedroom. The shadow followed, stretching and contracting with each movement, a dark puppeteer pulling invisible strings.

When Felix returned, he'd acquired a distinctly determined set to his shoulders. "Can you walk, or shall I—"

"I can walk." The lie came automatically, but Emil forced his body to honor it, accepting Felix's arm and rising with all the grace of a badly articulated skeleton. The journey to the bedroom covered perhaps twenty feet. It might as well have been miles.

Felix's bedroom was sparse, scholarly. Books stacked on every surface, architectural drawings pinned to the walls. The bed itself was narrow, meant for one, its white sheets turned down with hotel-like precision. Emil sank onto its edge and watched Felix shake out the sofa blanket, layer it over the existing bedding.

"There." Felix stepped back, not quite meeting his eyes. "That should—"

"You're planning to sit up." The accusation emerged without Emil's permission.

Felix's hands stilled on the blanket. "You need monitoring. Your heart rate—"

"Is stabilizing." Emil drew the deepest breath his compressed lungs would allow. Shame crawled up his throat like bile, but behind it came something else—a desperate practicality that had kept him alive this long. "Felix. I'm hypothermic. Post-prandial thermogenesis is—the metabolic cost of digestion without sufficient reserves—" The medical words tumbled out, a shield and a weapon both.

"Emil."

"I cannot maintain core temperature." Each word cost him something precious. "The tremors will worsen. Sitting in a chair all night serves no one."

Felix's shadow wavered on the wall, caught between advance and retreat. The silence stretched until Emil could hear his own pulse, still too quick, still uncertain.

"For warmth." Felix's voice had gone very quiet. "Medical necessity."

"Yes."

Neither of them acknowledged what else it might be. Felix moved to the far side of the bed with careful deliberation, maintaining maximum distance even as he slipped beneath the covers. The mattress dipped, the geography of the bed reorganizing itself around two bodies instead of one.

Emil lay rigid, acutely aware of every inch of space between them. The tremors continued their migration across his body, visible even through the layers of blankets. His teeth would begin chattering soon—another failure of control, another system breaking down.

"This is absurd," Felix muttered, and before Emil could parse his meaning, an arm came around his waist, drawing him back against solid warmth.

The shock of contact nearly stopped Emil's heart. When had he last been held? Not the clinical touch of examination, not the brief social contacts of handshakes and dinner parties, but this—another body offering its heat without reservation.

"Relax," Felix said against his shoulder. "You're shaking hard enough to rattle the bedframe."

Relax. As if Emil's body remembered how. But the warmth was seeping through his clothes, through his skin, reaching places that had been cold so long he'd forgotten they could be otherwise. The tremors began to ease, not all at once but in stages, like a watch winding down.

"Your hands are like ice," Felix observed. He captured one of them, folding it between his own palms. "How do you function like this?"

*I don't*, Emil thought but didn't say. Instead, he focused on the impossible luxury of warmth, of Felix's steady breathing against his back, of being held together when every instinct screamed to fall apart.

"Sleep," Felix murmured. "I'll wake you if anything changes."

The shadow on the wall had merged with the general darkness, no longer a separate entity but part of the night itself. Emil closed his eyes and let himself believe, for just these hours, that warmth was something he deserved.

A sharp reprise of a palpitation woke him suddenly. He was heavy, his limbs were too heavy for him to life them. Horror crawled up his throat like bile, or bile crawled up in his throat like horror. He tried to spring up, fear of seeing his form less than his anxious need to see. 
The pressure and weight lessened. Arms pulled back and allowed him to rise, sudden, with nothing but his own near weightlessness to raise. Bed. Bones. Felix. Safe. He let the shaking hands he ran over his body fall limp. Ah, Felix. He turned his head to see Felix laying next to him, expression guarded, carefully arranged into something safe. His professional face, Emil realized, but with an uncertainty he hadn't displayed since their undergrad days. 

"I'm sorry," Emil murmured. "I wake in the night occasionally. Tonight is one such night."

With the careful look of his, Emil has the sudden, absurd impression that Felix was like a young bride in her marriage bed, unsure of what to do with the man she finds beside her. And indeed, Felix bit his cheek, chewed his lips, wrinkling that perfect swoop of his cupids bow. Finally. "You were wrapping your hands around your wrists and looking at the bones in your hands." Too honest but darkness was upon them and in the safe quietude of their own winter season, sap was stilled and there no tensions to run high. Emil sighed and lay back down. Turned to look at Felix, barely visible in the dim bloom of reflected lamplight from the street below.

The darkness made honesty possible, or perhaps inevitable. Emil could just make out the curve of Felix's face, the worried line between his brows, the way he worried his lower lip between his teeth. Such an unguarded expression, so unlike his usual easy confidence.

"Yes," Emil said simply. There seemed no point in denial when Felix had seen him mapping his bones like a cartographer of his own destruction. "A habit. Like checking one's watch."

Felix made a sound that might have been protest or understanding or something caught between. The bed felt vast and tiny simultaneously, broad enough to hold this terrible knowledge between them, too narrow to escape the warmth of Felix's presence.

"How often?" Felix's voice was barely above a whisper.

"In the night? Always." Emil turned his gaze to the ceiling, where shadows from the streetlamp below painted abstract patterns. "The body changes during sleep. One must account for variables."

Silence stretched between them, not uncomfortable but weighted with things that couldn't be said in daylight. Felix shifted slightly, the bedclothes rustling with the movement. When he spoke again, his voice had lost its professional distance.

"I used to sketch you." The confession emerged haltingly. "Years ago. When we were students. You never knew."

Emil's breath caught. "I knew."

"You—what?"

"You weren't subtle. Always watching, always drawing." A pause, then the deeper truth: "I hated you for it."

Felix's intake of breath was audible. "Hated?"

"I thought you were mocking me. The way you looked at everything with such—such ease. As if the world were yours to capture and keep." Emil's hands had found each other beneath the blankets, fingers interlacing in their familiar lattice. "I couldn't understand why you would want to draw something like me unless it was to catalogue its flaws."

The mattress shifted as Felix propped himself on one elbow. In the dim light, Emil could see the shape of him, the fall of hair across his forehead, the earnest confusion in his posture.

"Something like you?" Felix's voice cracked slightly. "Emil, you were—you are—" He stopped, started again. "I drew you because I couldn't look away. Because you moved through the world like you were made of different matter than the rest of us. More refined. More essential."

Emil closed his eyes against the weight of those words. "Refined. Yes. That's one word for it."

"Don't." Felix's hand found his shoulder, warm through the thin fabric of his shirt. "Don't turn this into something ugly. Not tonight."

Tonight. This stolen bubble of time where Emil lay in Felix's bed, wrapped in borrowed warmth, his secrets spilled between them like ink on white sheets. Tomorrow would bring its own reckonings—the return to careful distances, the resumption of professional facades. But tonight...

"I still wake sometimes thinking I'm back there," Emil said to the ceiling. "In the sanatorium. They weighed us every morning. Recorded everything. Watched us eat. Watched us sleep. Clinical observation, they called it." His fingers tightened around each other. "I suppose I learned their lessons too well."

Felix's hand remained on his shoulder, neither retreating nor advancing, just present. An anchor. "You were young."

"Seventeen." The number felt strange in his mouth, belonging to someone else entirely. "They kept me for four months. Until I gained enough weight to be deemed functional. Until I could promise convincingly enough that I would maintain it."

"But you didn't."

"I did, for a time. Years, even." Emil turned his head to look at Felix again, finding those eyes fixed on him with an intensity that would have been unbearable in daylight. "And then I didn't."

The streetlamp flickered, sending shadows dancing across the walls. In their movement, Emil could almost see the shapes of all the selves he'd been—the too-thin teenager, the recovered student, the promising researcher, the man who counted every morsel and measured every bone and woke in the night to check that his body was still successfully disappearing.

"What changed?" Felix asked softly.

Emil considered the question, all its impossible answers. "Nothing. Everything. The feeling that I was taking up too much space returned. That I needed to be... less."

"Less." Felix repeated the word as if it were foreign. "You're already—" He stopped himself, but they both knew the end of that sentence.

"Not enough," Emil finished. "Never quite enough."

Felix made a sound, the type which escapes the self without their consent, a strange thing that pierces and fixes Emil in place like an insect on a sheet. Felix is so close that his eyes flick back and forth as they saccade between each of Emil's own. He is searching, like there is some solid bottom to be found at the hollows of the wells, perhaps the soul, as the Egyptians thought, or at least something beyond the retina and the nerves that drag the world into the brain. 

"What is it you see," Felix breathed. Fixed in place as he was by that gaze, Emil hoped bizarrely that he were some sort of Lepidoptera in Felix's collection, or at least Saturniidae, not some beetle.  Something not unpleasant. 

"I see... Someone I don't deserve to call my friend," Emil answered, a reluctant truth. 

A painful look twists Felix's brow. "I mean when you look at yourself." He paused and looked away, turned his head back again determined. "I know you don't see the terribly thin man I see before me, you clearly don't. I couldn't figure out why you would do this but that's it, isn't it? What is it that happens to you when you perceive yourself?" Felix's expression is open, raw, pleading.

The question hung between them like a chrysalis, something that might split open to reveal either transformation or decay. Emil felt his throat constrict, the words catching there like moths against glass.

"I see—" He stopped, started again. Felix's eyes held him steady, those minute movements between each iris like someone reading a text written in a language they were only beginning to understand. "I see occupation. Mass where there should be void. I see... excess."

Felix's brow furrowed deeper. "Excess. You think you're excessive?"

"Not think. Know." Emil's hands moved involuntarily, one wrapping around the opposite wrist, measuring. "Every morning the scale confirms it. Every reflection. The space I displace, the weight I carry—it's all documented proof of my failure to achieve..." He trailed off, unable to name what exactly he was trying to achieve.

"Achieve what?" Felix's voice had dropped to barely above a breath. "Invisibility? Nonexistence?"

"Refinement." The word emerged like a confession. "Distillation to essential components. The body as—as architectural principle. Only load-bearing elements. Nothing ornamental. Nothing superfluous."

Felix's hand tightened on his shoulder. "You're not a building, Emil."

"No. Buildings are honest about their structure." Emil could feel his pulse beneath his own fingers, that persistent evidence of his body's refusal to cooperate with his vision. "When I look in the mirror, I see... have you ever seen a photograph where someone moved during the exposure? That blur, that doubling? I see what is and what should be, superimposed. The current form is always wrong. Always too much."

"Too much," Felix repeated, and there was something broken in his voice. "Christ, Emil. When I carried you up those stairs, I thought—I was afraid I would drop you because there wasn't enough to hold onto. You're disappearing."

"Not disappearing. Revealing." Emil turned his face toward the ceiling again, unable to bear the intensity of Felix's examination. "Michelangelo claimed he revealed the sculpture already present in the marble. I'm simply removing excess material."

"You're not marble." Felix's voice cracked. "You're not stone. You're—you're blood and bone and you're dying, and you look at yourself and see excess?"

The moth metaphor returned to Emil's mind. Perhaps that's what he was becoming—something papery and light, all wing and no substance. Something that might crumble at a touch but could, for one brief moment, achieve flight.

"When I was seventeen," Emil said to the darkness, "in the sanatorium, they had us stand before mirrors. Full-length ones. Made us describe what we saw. The other patients would say 'bones,' 'skeleton,' 'corpse.' The doctors praised them for accuracy. But I..." He paused, remembering that terrible glass, his reflection wavering in it. "I saw abundance. Flesh clinging where it wasn't needed. Taking up space that didn't belong to me."

Felix made that sound again, involuntary and raw. His hand slid from Emil's shoulder to his face, palm gentle against his cheek. "What would it take?" he whispered. "For you to see what I see?"

Emil turned into the touch without meaning to, his body betraying him with its hunger for contact. "New eyes," he said simply. "Different architecture in the mind. Some fundamental restructuring I don't know how to achieve."

They lay suspended in that moment, Felix's hand warm against Emil's face, the streetlight painting patterns of light and shadow across them both. Emil felt pinned not unpleasantly, like one of those night-flying moths drawn to Felix's lamp, circling closer despite knowing the danger of fixed attention.

"Take mine. Pluck them out and take them as a gift, I would gladly give them." The offered orbs, Emil realized with a start, were wet with tears. 

"I would give you any piece of myself if it were the one to supplant these thoughts and visions," Felix whispered, voice cracking. 

Emil searched around the cavern of his mind and found no words for reply. Something was lodged in his heart, something that was entirely unlike the thorns from earlier but which paralyzed him still. Dangerous. So dangerous. His breath was still, he was afraid to move. 

"Ever since I met you I couldn't bear to be apart from you. You are brilliant and enigmatic and so terribly frighteningly beautiful. Do you know that our sun is said to gather rogue planets up in his orbit? Little motes of rock, passing by, helpless not to turn away from their straight path, made to fall in circles around him. I haven't been my own since I met you. Who would snuff the sun out? Plunge those planets into a darkness more complete for having know its light?" Real tears ran down his cheeks in earnest now. 

The words fell on Emil like burning stars, each one searing through the careful architecture of distance he had built. Felix's tears were warm where they had fallen on Emil's neck, small mercies against skin gone cold with more than hunger.

A sun. Felix saw him as a sun. The absurdity of it closed Emil's throat entirely. He who spent each day calculating new ways to diminish, to occupy less space, to reduce his presence to the barest mathematical minimum—how could he be anyone's celestial center?

"Felix." The name emerged strangled, barely sound at all.

"I know you don't—that you can't—" Felix's voice broke entirely. "But I needed you to know. Before you succeed in what you're trying to do. Before you finish disappearing."

Emil's hands rose without his permission, finding Felix's face in the darkness, thumbs brushing at the wet tracks there. The bones of Felix's face were perfect beneath his palms—architectural, as Emil had always known them to be. Strong and certain where his own were sharp with deprivation.

"You mistake me for light," Emil whispered, "when I am only hunger given form."

"No." Felix turned his face into Emil's palm, pressing a kiss there that sent shock waves through Emil's careful control. "I mistake nothing. I have watched you for years. Sketched you until I could draw you from memory alone. You consume yourself and call it refinement, but I see what remains—brilliance that burns despite your best efforts to extinguish it."

The thing lodged in Emil's heart grew thorns of its own, but sweet ones, terrible ones that threatened to crack him open entirely. He could feel Felix trembling against him, or perhaps that was his own shaking—it had become impossible to tell where one of them ended and the other began.

"I am not worth—" Emil began, but Felix silenced him with a sound of pure anguish.

"You are worth everything." Felix's hands came up to cover Emil's, holding them against his face. "Worth more than all my sketches, all my buildings, all my careful preservation. I would tear down cathedrals if it would make you see yourself clearly for even a moment."

The darkness spun around them, or perhaps that was Emil's vertigo returning. He was drowning in Felix's words, in the salt of his tears, in the terrible possibility that someone could look at his careful self-destruction and see something worth orbiting.

"I don't know how to be a sun," Emil confessed, the words pulled from some deep place he'd thought successfully starved. "I only know how to reduce myself to atoms."

"Then be atoms." Felix's voice fierce now, desperate. "Be particles. Be light waves. Be whatever form you must, but exist. Continue. Stay."

The streetlamp flickered again, casting them in alternating moments of shadow and illumination. In those brief lit seconds, Emil could see Felix's face clearly—the raw devotion there, the terror, the love that had apparently been growing in darkness like some impossible plant that needed no light to flourish.

"I'm frightened," Emil heard himself say. The truth of it struck him like diagnosis—he was terrified. Not of death, which seemed mathematical and clean, but of this: being seen, being held, being loved despite or perhaps because of his careful campaigns against himself.

"So am I," Felix whispered. "Terrified. Every day I watch you fade a little more. Every sketch I make captures less of you than the one before. I'm trying to preserve you in paper and ink because I can't seem to preserve you in flesh."

Emil's hands were shaking now, violent tremors that had nothing to do with cold or hunger. Felix held them steady, anchoring him to this moment, this bed, this impossible declaration that threatened everything Emil had built his life around.

"I don't know how to stop," Emil admitted, the words barely audible. "I don't know how to want to stop."

"Then let me want it for you," Felix said simply. "Let me hold enough desire for life for both of us, until you can find your own again."

The moth in Emil's chest beat its wings frantically, drawn to this flame despite every instinct screaming danger. He was going to burn. He was going to be consumed. But for the first time in longer than he could remember, that seemed less terrifying than the alternative—the slow, calculated extinguishing he'd been orchestrating for years.

"Felix," he said again, and this time the name held everything he couldn't say: the reciprocal orbit of his own attachment, the guilty hoarding of every sketch glimpsed, the way Felix's presence made him feel both more real and more impossible, the terrible love that had grown in the dark of his own denial.

Felix seemed to hear it all anyway. He drew Emil closer, until there was no space between them for shadows or shame, only shared warmth and the salt of tears and the fragile possibility of morning.

And possibilities, despite having varied mathematical vagaries, do yield to probabilities and morning does come, the coin toss won for yet another day. 

Emil can never be fixed. He knows this as fundamentally as he knows that Felix presses his own celestial physical rules against him in turn. Perhaps a binary system. Why else is he laying in his bed, speaking the dessicated ugly parts of himself aloud to this man who could never, must never! know what it is to become hollowed out.  He can't even do more than slow his dissolution, hope to fix it where it is. Can't do more than that but. Can't do more than that. Can't return back down the path he has trod, he's turned his head and looked back at the leaf covered way, the waypoints lost. He can't do more than slow or fix it as it is. He can't. But. Perhaps. He violently wished to light the bed on fire, burn the entire apartment down, bring it down upon his head and immolate himself, cremating his remains amongst the ruins. Emil keeps himself from leaping up, what would be some pointless aborted aimless motion to vent this tension. Emil can never be fixed, but perhaps he can try to glue the extant pieces together, to fix the current form, like the Japanese would mend a broken cup. 

Felix stirred next to him, perhaps awakened by his violently moving thoughts, perhaps awakened only by the morning diffusing through the curtains. He reached a hand out towards the bedside table, aborted the motion, settled for staring focused at Emil. 

Emil furrowed his brow. "You want to sketch me," he says, half a question.

Felix's hand hung suspended between bed and table, caught in the act of reaching for what must be his sketching materials. The morning light revealed everything—the guilty desire in his expression, the way his fingers curved as if already holding charcoal.

"Always," Felix admitted, letting his hand fall back to the sheets. "Every moment. But especially now."

Now. When Emil lay exposed in all his careful ruination, the morning light unforgiving across the sharp geography of his bones. When the traces of salt from last night's tears still lingered on both their faces. When the possibility of change hung between them fragile as spun glass.

"You want to document the damage." Emil's voice came out neutral, clinical. An observation.

"I want to capture the moment you decided to stop." Felix's eyes hadn't left his face. "If that's what this is. If that's what last night meant."

Emil considered the violent impulses still racing through his body—to flee, to burn, to reduce himself to ash rather than face the terrible prospect of maintenance. His fingers found each other beneath the blanket, measuring the circumference of his wrists automatically.

"I can't be repaired," he said carefully. "The original form is lost. There's no returning to it."

"I'm not asking you to." Felix shifted closer, minutely, as if Emil were a wild animal that might bolt. "I'm asking if you might... arrest the decay. Like a conservator would. Stop the active destruction, even if restoration isn't possible."

The kintsugi metaphor returned, gold filling the cracks of something shattered. But Emil had no gold to offer, only the base metal of his own exhausted will.

"I don't know how." The admission scraped his throat raw. "The calculations are automatic now. The measurements. The subtractions. It's not a choice anymore, it's... architecture. Built into the foundation."

Felix's hand twitched again toward the bedside table. "Then let me draw it. The architecture. Maybe if we can see it clearly, map it properly, we can find the load-bearing walls. The places where intervention might be possible without bringing everything down."

Emil almost laughed at the extended metaphor—Felix trying to understand him through the language of buildings, of preservation, of structural engineering. But there was something in it, perhaps. A way of examining the problem that didn't require him to feel, only to analyze.

"You want to sketch my pathology." Not quite a question.

"I want to sketch you." Felix's voice went soft again. "The you that exists right now, in this moment, when you've admitted the possibility of stopping. Before you talk yourself out of it. Before the day makes its demands and you remember all the reasons why you can't."

The morning light had grown stronger, painting Felix's face in shades of gold and amber. He looked tired, worn by the night's revelations, but there was something fierce in his expression too. The look of someone preparing to fight for a preservation project everyone else had written off as hopeless.

Emil closed his eyes, feeling the weight of his body in the bed—too much and not enough, always and forever out of proportion to what it should be. But Felix's warmth beside him was a counterweight, a different kind of mathematics that didn't require reduction to balance.

"If you sketch me," Emil said slowly, "you sketch what is. Not what was or what might be. This." He gestured vaguely at himself, the sharp angles and hollow spaces, the architectural impossibility of his current form.

"Yes," Felix agreed immediately. "This. Exactly this. The moment when you're considering whether to continue the demolition or let the structure stand."

Emil opened his eyes, meeting Felix's gaze. The terrible love from last night was still there, patient and steady as load-bearing stone. It made him want to calculate exactly how much weight such love could bear before it, too, collapsed.

"Get your materials," he said before he could think better of it. "But I make no promises about tomorrow."

Felix's smile was small but radiant, sun through clouds. He rose from the bed with careful movements, gathering his sketching supplies with the reverence of someone preparing for communion. And perhaps that's what this was—a kind of sacrament, the documentation of a moment balanced precisely between destruction and its cessation.

Emil remained still, feeling the absence of Felix's warmth like another kind of hunger. 

Felix moved with the controlled urgency of someone defusing an explosive. His materials appeared on the bed between them—worn leather portfolio, sticks of charcoal wrapped in paper, the good sketching paper he usually reserved for architectural details. His hands trembled slightly as he arranged everything, a cartographer preparing to map uncharted territory.

"Don't move," he said softly, though Emil had shown no sign of doing so. "Just—be as you are."

The first sketch came quickly, Felix's hand flying across the paper with practiced efficiency. He barely looked at the page, his eyes fixed on Emil with an intensity that should have been uncomfortable but instead felt like being truly seen for the first time. The charcoal whispered across paper, documenting the angle of shoulder against pillow, the hollow beneath the clavicle, the way morning light caught on the sharp edge of cheekbone.

Felix tore the page free without ceremony, already beginning the next. This one focused on Emil's hands where they lay against the white sheet—those architectural marvels of bone and tendon that Emil saw as excessive but Felix rendered with the reverence typically reserved for cathedral spires. 

"You're rushing," Emil observed.

"Yes." Felix didn't pause in his work. "You could change your mind. The light could shift. The world could end." A third sketch now, this one of Emil's profile, the delicate engineering of his skull beneath insufficient flesh. "I need to document this before it vanishes."

Emil remained still, a reluctant specimen under Felix's loving scrutiny. He could feel himself being translated into lines and shadows, reduced not to numbers on a scale but to art. It was a different kind of measurement, one that seemed to add rather than subtract.

Felix worked in silence broken only by the scratch of charcoal and their breathing. Four sketches, five, six. Some were mere studies—the curve of Emil's wrist, the relationship between neck and shoulder. Others attempted to capture the whole, Emil's form arranged on the bed like a medieval saint, all angles and otherworldly geometry.

Finally, Felix's hand stilled. He looked down at the scattered pages with something like wonder, then carefully gathered them, arranging them so Emil could see.

"Here," he said quietly. "This is what I see."

Emil pushed himself up on one elbow, accepting the offered sketches with hands that only trembled slightly. The first drawing made him catch his breath—not because it was accurate, but because it wasn't. The figure on the page was indeed thin, yes, but drawn with such tenderness that it transformed pathology into something almost elegant.

"You've drawn me thinner than I am," Emil said automatically, though the words felt strange in his mouth. The sketch showed his true state—the concave spaces, the too-prominent bones—but somehow Felix had made them beautiful, like the flying buttresses of a Gothic cathedral.

"Have I?" Felix moved closer, comparing sketch to subject. "I don't think so."

Emil moved to the next drawing, then the next. In each, Felix had found something different to emphasize—the length of his fingers in one, the curve of his throat in another. They were undeniably him, yet filtered through Felix's perception into something that bore no resemblance to what Emil saw in mirrors.

"And handsomer," Emil added, attempting levity but achieving only a kind of wondering confusion. "You've made me look like a Romantic poet dying of consumption. Tragic but noble."

"You are handsome." Felix said it simply, as fact. "The tragedy is that you're dying of something far more preventable than consumption, and there's nothing noble about it. But yes, you're handsome. Beautiful, even. Especially now, when you're considering living."

Emil studied a sketch that showed his entire form, the landscape of his body mapped with careful attention. Felix had captured the damage—there was no hiding the sharp edges, the hollow spaces—but he'd also caught something else. A quality of light, perhaps, or the way even diminished things could hold their own strange grace.

"I don't understand what you see," Emil admitted. "When I look at these, I see... documentation. Evidence. But you seem to see something else entirely."

"I see you," Felix said. "Not the mathematical reduction you've made of yourself, not the ideal form you're trying to achieve through subtraction. Just you. Emil. Who exists, who takes up space, who deserves to continue taking up space."

Emil traced a finger along one of the sketches, following the line of his own arm as Felix had rendered it. "It's still too much," he said quietly. "Even like this. Even through your eyes."

"Then we work from here," Felix said. "Not to make you less, but to help you see what I see. Or at least to help you tolerate what exists without trying to eliminate it further."

The sketches lay between them, evidence of Emil's current form preserved in charcoal and care. Emil found himself thinking of architectural drawings, blueprints that showed not what would be built but what already stood. Perhaps that was enough for now—to be documented as he was, to exist in Felix's perception even if he couldn't yet exist comfortably in his own.

"Keep them," he said suddenly, pushing the sketches back toward Felix. "I can't look at them properly yet. But keep them. As record."

Felix gathered the drawings carefully, as if they were precious documents. Which perhaps they were—evidence of the morning Emil had considered, if not recovery, then at least cessation. The morning he'd allowed himself to be seen and sketched and found, impossibly, beautiful in his ruin.

"I'll keep them," Felix promised. "And when you're ready, we'll look at them again. See if your perception has shifted at all."

Emil lay back against the pillows, exhausted by the simple act of being observed without defending himself against the observation.
