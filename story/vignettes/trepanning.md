Eduard lifts the skull with a reverence that borders on tenderness. "Do you see this, Emil? Would you like to observe where love resides within the human form?" He beckons Emil closer with a curl of his finger. "Here. Look closely."
He traces the weathered circular hole on the crown, his fingertip following its edges with precision. "This crude aperture—do you know what you're witnessing? The most desperate act of love our ancestors could conceive." His voice drops to nearly a whisper. "Imagine the first human who dared this. No chloroform, no ether — nothing but flint and bone and terror. Yet they cut."
Eduard angles the skull toward the lamp, allowing light to pool inside its hollow. "Consider what compelled their hands, to take up stone against skull, to violate nature's most perfect vault. They must have known they were more likely to create a corpse than effect a cure."
He holds the skull at eye level, peering through the trepanation hole as if searching for something lost within. "And yet... evidence of healing around these wounds. They survived, Emil. Some of them survived." His thumb caresses the bone's smooth interior surface.
"This is medicine in its purest form — not our modern comforts, not our sterile instruments. This." He taps the hole lightly. "Pain and blood and suffering given purpose through desperate hope. The brutal prayer that perhaps..." He pauses, eyes fixed on Emil's gaunt face. "Perhaps we might wring life from the very earth that claims us all."
Eduard sets the skull down carefully, but his gaze remains intent on Emil. "We practitioners fancy ourselves scientists now, with our microscopes and our precise taxonomies. But never forget — beneath the white coat beats the heart of that first primitive surgeon, willing to wound in order to heal."
