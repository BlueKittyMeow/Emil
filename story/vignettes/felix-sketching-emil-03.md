The Long Walk in the Rain
Prague streets, evening, steady rain
Emil stepped from the shelter of Felix's doorway into the rain. His umbrella provided minimal protection against the slanting downpour, but the physical discomfort registered as little more than data—temperature approximately twelve degrees Celsius, wind from the northeast, rainfall moderate to heavy.
He had no intention of returning to his apartment, despite what he'd told Felix. The thought of sitting at his desk, confronted by the lecture notes that needed revision, felt suffocating after the sketch incident. His feet carried him past the turning that would lead to his rooms, continuing instead along the darkening streets.
The gaslights of Prague created wavering coronas in the rain. Emil calculated his route with practiced efficiency—the longer path around the university district, past the shuttered shops, down toward the river. Two hours of walking would correct for the tea he'd accepted at Felix's apartment, though he'd barely touched it. The rain added resistance, increasing the expenditure of energy. Satisfactory.
But his mind refused to perform the usual calming calculations of calories and distance. Instead, it circled relentlessly around the sketch Felix had shown him.
Far too thin, he had said, the lie careful and deliberate. But Felix had contradicted him with the simple assurance of someone stating objective fact rather than opinion. That's precisely how you appeared.
Emil's pace quickened slightly. What other sketches remained in Felix's portfolio? He had mentioned university days, but which period? Before the collapse, when Emil had been disgustingly soft, undisciplined? Or after, during recovery, when they had forced him to regain what he had so carefully eliminated?
Or—a thought that both pleased and disturbed him—had Felix begun sketching him only after they became friends, when Emil had already achieved a more acceptable form? The first time they spoke properly had been after Felix's return from abroad, after Emil's absence from the university. Emil had already been under medical supervision then, already been forced to compromise his discipline in order to return to his studies.
The rain soaked through the shoulders of his coat, but Emil barely registered it. His mind constructed and reconstructed the timeline with scientific precision, attempting to determine which version of himself existed in Felix's sketches.
He passed the dark windows of Anton's grocery, closed hours ago. The grocer had become increasingly forward with his concern, speaking to Emil in Czech as if the shared language permitted such intrusions. The dumplings had been the latest offense—Emil had disposed of them in a public trash bin three streets from his apartment.
The Vltava appeared through the rain as he approached the embankment. In summer, this area would be crowded with evening strollers, but now only a few hurried figures moved through the downpour, heads bent against the weather. Emil walked along the river's edge, the sound of rain on water creating a constant static that crowded out thought.
Felix saw too much. That was the problem. Most people observed only what confirmed their existing beliefs, but Felix's artist eye recorded with mechanical precision. Emil had recognized himself in that sketch—the sharpness of his features, the collar that no longer fit properly despite being his smallest size. Felix had captured exactly how he appeared rather than how Emil needed to be seen.
It was the accuracy that disturbed him most. Not exaggeration, but truth.
A figure emerged from the rain ahead, moving toward the sheltered area beneath a bridge. As Emil drew closer, he recognized the distinctive shape of Dr. Weber's umbrella and the professor's characteristic gait. Emil altered his course immediately, turning up a side street to avoid the encounter. Weber had been watching him with increasing attention in recent weeks, his clinical gaze too similar to Felix's artistic one—seeing what Emil worked to conceal.
The rain intensified, but Emil continued walking, his route now taking him in a wide arc that would eventually return him to his rooms. His coat hung heavy with water, the added weight requiring additional energy to move. The calculation offered brief comfort—kilometers traveled, energy expended, balance maintained.
But his mind returned to Felix's apartment, to the careful neutrality in his friend's eyes when Emil had challenged the sketch. Felix hadn't argued. He'd simply stated what he saw, then offered to show earlier sketches—evidence from a time Emil preferred not to remember.
A memory surfaced unexpectedly—Felix appearing in the library after his return from abroad, settling across from Emil without comment or question when others had approached with careful concern or evident discomfort. Felix had simply begun sketching the library's architectural details, occasionally asking Emil about a medical text he was reviewing, treating him with neither the excessive solicitude nor the barely concealed curiosity that had characterized other interactions.
That normalcy had been like oxygen after months of being observed as a medical specimen. Felix had seen him clearly even then, but had chosen not to comment on what he saw.
Emil paused beneath the temporary shelter of an archway, water streaming from his saturated clothing. In the distance, the dark shape of the hospital was just visible through the rain—the place where he had spent three months under observation before being permitted to return to his studies. He still avoided that entire district when possible, taking longer routes to circumvent the memories housed there.
Something from Felix's drawing table flashed in his memory—a partial glimpse of another sketch showing the back view of a figure that might have been him, seated at a lecture. Had Felix been documenting his decline all along, creating a visual medical record without Emil's knowledge or consent?
The thought should have angered him, but instead produced a strange, disturbing comfort. Someone was witnessing his transformation, recording the progress he himself tracked in numbers and measurements. Felix's sketches were a kind of validation—evidence that the changes Emil worked toward were visible, real.
By the time he reached his apartment building, Emil's clothing was completely soaked through, his skin chilled. He calculated the additional energy his body would expend generating heat to compensate for the drop in temperature. The household staff would have retired hours ago, leaving him to navigate the darkened stairway alone.
In his rooms, he methodically removed his wet clothing, hanging each piece precisely to dry. His reflection in the mirror above his washstand caught his attention—the sharp angles of his face emphasized in the harsh lamplight, the hollow beneath each cheekbone exactly as Felix had rendered it.
You've made me look far too thin, he had said.
That's precisely how you appeared, Felix had answered.
Emil traced the outline of his collarbone with clinical detachment. Felix saw clearly. That was the threat—and the strange comfort—he presented. In a world where Emil carefully managed others' perceptions, Felix simply observed and recorded without judgment or intervention.
On his desk, the lecture notes waited, but Emil instead took out his own notebook—the leather-bound record of his private measurements and calculations. He added the evening's data with scientific precision: estimated distance walked, duration, weather conditions, probable energy expenditure.
In a moment of unusual impulse, he noted in the margin: F. sketch—accurate observation. The admission felt both dangerous and necessary, like a scientific truth that complicated a cherished theory but couldn't be ignored.
Outside his window, Prague disappeared into the darkness and rain, the city becoming a collection of scattered lights and indistinct shapes. Somewhere across those blurred lights, Felix would be completing his own documentation—architectural details and perhaps another sketch from memory, adding to the visual record of Emil's careful disappearance.
Emil closed his notebook and finally turned to his lecture notes, the evening's walking having restored his ability to focus. Tomorrow would require precision, discipline. Felix would likely be waiting to walk with him to the university, umbrella in hand, observing but not commenting on Emil's late-night journey through the rain.
There was comfort in being seen without being stopped. For now, at least, that delicate balance could be maintained.
