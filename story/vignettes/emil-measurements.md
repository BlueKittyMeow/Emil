1. Emil's Self-Measurement Ritual
Emil's apartment, early morning before dawn
Half-past four. The small clock on Emil's desk marked the time with clinical precision.
He moved through his morning ritual with practiced efficiency, each action recorded in the leather-bound notebook open on his desk. The gas lamp cast precise shadows as he positioned the scale in exactly the same spot as every morning—the one place where the floorboards didn't slope.
First, the weight: shedding his nightshirt, he stood naked on the cold metal platform, eyes fixed on the balance beam. The counterweight slid into position with a soft click. He recorded the number with a slight smile of satisfaction.
Next, measurements: chest circumference, waist, upper arms. The tape measure was pulled taut, each number carefully documented alongside yesterday's figures, the minute differences calculated and noted.
Pulse at rest: sixty-three. Slightly elevated from yesterday's sixty-one. He frowned, making a note to extend his evening walk.
Only after completing the documentation did he allow himself to dress, selecting a shirt that had once fit perfectly but now required extensive pinning at the back. The collar hung loose around his neck despite the smallest available size.
He checked his watch—four fifty-two. Plenty of time to review yesterday's caloric documentation before beginning his walk to the university. The day's lectures were already prepared, allowing him this time for his more important work: the careful management of his own specimen.
