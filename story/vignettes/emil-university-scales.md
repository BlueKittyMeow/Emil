Half-past three in the morning. The Physiology Department corridor stretched empty, its gas lamps reduced to their night-time setting. The diminished yellow light cast elongated shadows that seemed to reach toward Emil with spectral fingers as he moved silently along the polished floor.
The key to the examination room weighed in his pocket, its authorization granted for his "early morning research requirements"—a technical truth that concealed a different purpose. His footsteps echoed despite his attempts at silence, each sound amplified in the nocturnal emptiness of the university building.
The brass handle of the examination room turned with the faintest resistance. Inside, medical equipment gleamed dully in the weak light filtering through tall windows. Emil's gaze fixed immediately on the platform scale positioned against the far wall—a precision instrument, superior to his own, calibrated weekly by department technicians.
He locked the door behind him, though the building stood practically deserted at this hour. Perhaps old Dvorak, the night porter, made his rounds, but the man knew better than to disturb the research physicians when they worked unusual hours. Science demanded sacrifice, after all.
Emil's fingers worked methodically at his clothing, removing each layer with deliberate care. Jacket, carefully draped over the examination table. Waistcoat, folded precisely. Pocket watch, placed atop the pile with its face down to avoid catching light. Shoes, positioned with mathematical precision. Trousers, creased exactly.
The ritual continued until he stood in his undergarments, the room's chill raising gooseflesh across his exposed skin. His reflection caught momentarily in the window glass—a ghostly figure, ribcage visible beneath stretched skin, collar bones casting shadows.
He stepped onto the scale with the reverence of a communicant approaching an altar. The balance beam required adjustment, his fingers moving the counterweight with practiced precision. The moment of truth approached with mechanical inevitability as the beam settled.
Sixty-three point four kilograms.
Emil recorded the figure in a leather notebook retrieved from his jacket, its pages filled with columns of dates and measurements. His handwriting remained clinically detached—the documentation of an experiment rather than a personal record. The previous week's figure had been sixty-four point one.
A tremor passed through his hands as he recorded the reduction. The mind registered satisfaction while the body manifested its objection through an involuntary shudder. He quickly dressed, each layer of clothing reconstructing Dr. Králik, respected researcher, from the naked specimen moment by moment.
As he locked the examination room behind him, the distant chime of the university clock marked quarter past four. The corridor remained empty, the silence broken only by his footsteps and the sound of his own pulse in his ears. He had perfected the timing of these visits through careful observation of the building's rhythms—the hours when even the most dedicated researchers had departed and before the morning cleaning staff arrived.
Outside, Prague lay shrouded in pre-dawn fog, the gas lamps creating halos in the mist. The cobblestones felt uneven beneath Emil's feet as he began his calculated journey home, the distance measured in footsteps, the exertion carefully factored into his internal ledger of expenditure.
