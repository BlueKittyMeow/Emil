The Dvorak residence gleamed with lamplight, the annual faculty gathering in full attendance. Emil navigated the crowded drawing room with practiced precision, maintaining appropriate professional distances, exchanging the expected pleasantries with colleagues while carefully balancing a glass of burgundy he had no intention of consuming.
Professor Dvorak's home represented old Prague wealth—ornate ceilings, imported furnishings, and the unmistakable evidence of generations of academic prestige. Emil had attended this gathering for three consecutive years, each time noting the subtle shifts in departmental hierarchies reflected in conversational groupings and seating arrangements.
The evening progressed according to established pattern until Emil, seeking momentary respite from social demands, found himself in an unfamiliar anteroom. The Dvoraks had evidently redecorated since the previous year's gathering. Where once stood a modest writing desk now gleamed an ornate cheval glass mirror in a carved mahogany frame, positioned to catch light from both the anteroom lamps and the adjoining corridor.
Emil's entrance coincided with another figure's appearance in the glass—a slim silhouette in evening attire, elegantly proportioned, with a certain graceful economy of form. The practiced social smile froze on Emil's face as he recognized Felix's distinctive posture.
"Remarkable," he murmured, momentarily forgetting himself. "The precision of line. The economy of form."
The sculptural elegance of the figure struck Emil with unusual force—the way light defined collar bones beneath formal evening wear, the clean architectural lines of the jaw, the almost artistic hollowness beneath the cheekbones. The figure embodied a certain aesthetic perfection, a purity of form that transcended conventional robustness.
Emil tilted his head, noting how the figure performed the same movement with perfect synchronization. A curious coincidence. He stepped closer to the glass, and the figure approached with identical timing.
Something in the movement triggered recognition. Not Felix, then. His own reflection.
But rather than disappointment, a wave of satisfaction washed over him. Had he truly progressed to such a state that he could mistake himself for Felix? The thought carried immense gratification. For years he had observed Felix's natural slenderness with a mixture of professional admiration and personal envy. To have achieved a composition that could, even momentarily, be confused with that innate elegance represented significant experimental success.
Emil moved closer to the mirror, conducting a thorough visual analysis. Yes, there was definite improvement in structural definition—the emergent architectural clarity of facial bones, the satisfying hollowness beneath the cheekbones, the promising visibility of clavicles beneath his formal attire.
Yet critical assessment identified numerous remaining inadequacies. The jawline, while improved, lacked Felix's natural precision. The throat retained unnecessary tissue that obscured its structural elements. The wrists, despite recent progress, still carried excess that diminished their potential elegance.
"Still substantial work required," he noted with clinical detachment, mentally calculating necessary adjustments to his regimen. Perhaps another forty-five minutes of evening walking would accelerate progress. Further reduction in clear broth consumption seemed indicated as well.
Emil found himself nodding at the reflection, acknowledging both progress made and corrections required. The scientific method demanded rigorous assessment and protocol adjustments based on empirical evidence. The mirror had simply provided necessary data for experimental refinement.
He performed a final evaluation, noting with satisfaction how his formal attire—despite his tailor's puzzling resistance to proper fitting—revealed evidence of progress. The collar now accommodated two fingers rather than the excessive single finger of previous months. The waistcoat hung with a certain mathematical precision that approached, if not yet achieved, the ideal.
As Emil prepared to return to the gathering, the door opened to admit another guest seeking temporary escape from social obligations. Dr. Meyer paused, his expression shifting from polite acknowledgment to something Emil couldn't immediately categorize.
"Králik," Meyer said, his professional tone layered with an unexpected quality. "Are you quite well? The lighting in here is rather unflattering to everyone, I find."
Emil recognized the social gambit—Meyer's attempt at delicate inquiry disguised as casual observation. The concern reflected professional courtesy rather than legitimate medical necessity.
"Quite well, thank you," Emil replied with appropriate professional distance. "Simply taking a moment to collect my thoughts before rejoining the conversation. Professor Hoffman's theories on neurological regeneration demand careful consideration."
Meyer seemed to accept this explanation, though his gaze lingered momentarily on Emil's form before he nodded and withdrew. The interaction would require documentation in Emil's social ledger—further evidence of colleagues' unnecessary preoccupation with appearance rather than intellectual substance.
Emil returned to the drawing room, his social mask firmly in place, the untouched wine glass balanced in fingers that displayed, to his satisfaction, increasingly visible metacarpal definition. Across the room, Felix engaged in animated conversation with Professor Dvorak's wife, his gestures displaying the natural grace that Emil's research sought to achieve through more deliberate means.
Emil calculated the socially appropriate duration remaining before he could reasonably depart. Forty-seven minutes, accounting for necessary conversations with at least three senior faculty members and the customary acknowledgments to his hosts.
The encounter with his reflection had provided valuable experimental data. Tonight's documentation would include detailed observations regarding structural progress and necessary protocol adjustments. Emil moved through the gathering with renewed purpose, each social interaction precisely calculated, each movement carefully controlled.
The reflection had confirmed both progress and inadequacy in equal measure. The work continued, the experiment advanced, the transformation remained incomplete but undeniably underway. Emil's satisfaction at being momentarily mistaken for Felix—even by his own perception—provided motivation for continued refinement.
Science, after all, demanded nothing less than methodical progression toward the ideal.
