Transition to Informal Address
Between Felix and Emil (Historical Transition)
Prague University, 1888, after a particularly heated academic debate in which they found themselves unexpected allies
"Herr Králik, a moment if you would," Felix called, catching up to Emil in the corridor. "Your argument regarding the Paracelsus text was quite remarkable."
Emil adjusted his papers, maintaining careful distance. "Herr von Rothenberg. Your intervention was... timely."
"The faculty's expressions were worth the breach of protocol," Felix said, smiling. "We should continue this discussion. Perhaps at the Café Imperial this evening?"
Three hours and several coffees later, their conversation had moved from medieval medical texts to architectural theory to personal histories.
"I believe," Felix said, refilling Emil's cup without asking, "after dismantling Professor Weber's entire thesis together, we might dispense with formalities. I am Felix, if you would do me the honor."

Emil hesitated, unused to such easy familiarity. "I... yes. Emil, then."
Felix raised his cup in a small toast. "To Emil, and the beginning of a more interesting conversation."


Between Felix and Klara

"Herr von Rothenberg, you have the advantage of most men in that you can literally place me wherever you wish in a room," Klara said, arranging her skirts. "I should at least know the name of my transportation."
Felix laughed. "Felix, please. And I promise to only deposit you in locations with superior views and interesting company."
"Felix, then. And I am Klara to my friends and bearers alike."
"I hope to qualify as both, Klara," he replied, settling beside her as naturally as if they'd known each other for years.
