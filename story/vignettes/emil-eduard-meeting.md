# Morning After: Emil and Eduard's Meeting

The morning light filtered through Eduard's office windows, casting long shadows across the polished desk between them. Emil had arrived precisely on time, his posture carefully maintained despite the lingering weakness from yesterday's episode. He had spent forty minutes preparing for this encounter, calculating precisely how to stand, speak, and gesture to project robust health.

"How are you feeling this morning, Dr. Králik?" Eduard asked, gesturing to the chair opposite. A tea service sat on the side table, steam rising from the pot.

Emil settled himself with measured movements. "Quite recovered, thank you, Herr Doktor. The episode was regrettable but hardly consequential."

"I had the laboratory assistant fetch your notes from yesterday." Eduard pushed the notebook across the desk. "Remarkable presence of mind to document your observations before losing consciousness."

"The data must be preserved," Emil replied, accepting the book without opening it. His grip tightened momentarily on the leather cover—a physical anchor in the increasingly uncomfortable conversation. "May I ask what diagnosis you favor regarding yesterday's incident, sir?"

Eduard's eyes narrowed slightly. "An interesting question." He paused. "Sir William Gull might remind us that 'fools and savages explain; wise men investigate.'"

"You're familiar with Gull's work, of course." Emil kept his voice neutral, professional.

"Extensively." Eduard poured tea into two cups, his movements precise and deliberate. The formality of the ritual created a momentary reprieve. "His observations on nervous conditions were particularly insightful." This last comment delivered with a pointed glance that belied the casual tone.

Emil accepted the tea but did not drink. "Let us speak plainly, Herr Doktor." He straightened in his chair. "You expressed concern about the effect my removal would have on the lecture schedule, and you are right to do so."

"We presumed you were still insensate—" Eduard began, but Emil cut him off before he could complete the thought.

"You wish me to recover my strength." Emil pressed on, his voice taking on the confident cadence he used in lectures. "Well, I have been attempting to shore up my constitution, and the best thing for me is mental distraction from a nervous stomach. I shall happily spend the semester recess in idyllic repose if you so insist, but inactivity would be the worst thing for my own constitution and for that of the college."

Eduard set down his cup with a faint click against the saucer. "Are you sleeping, Emil?"

The sudden shift to his given name—a privilege Eduard rarely exercised—landed with calculated impact. Emil blinked once, the only visible reaction he allowed himself. "I sleep adequately for my needs."

"Gull observed that 'a well-fed brain sleeps well.'" Eduard's gaze was steady. "I imagine the same principle applies to a well-fed body."

"My dear mentor," Emil replied, shifting to a tone of intimate respect that acknowledged their long academic relationship, "I may be an anesthesiologist, not a general practitioner, but last I checked, I was not in possession of organs necessary for the diagnosis you seem to be contemplating."

Eduard's expression sobered. "Which diagnosis would that be, Dr. Králik?" The formal title signaled a retreat to professional distance, his brief moment of personal concern firmly closed.

"One typically reserved for hysterical young women." Emil allowed a note of professional amusement to enter his voice. "I assure you, my condition is merely the consequence of overwork and perhaps excessive coffee."

Eduard leaned back, studying Emil with the same careful attention he might give to an unusual laboratory specimen. "The human body, regardless of sex, operates under certain immutable principles. Gull understood this when he noted that anorexia nervosa, while more common in females, does occur in males."

Emil's fingers tightened almost imperceptibly on the teacup. "A fascinating academic observation, certainly. But scarcely relevant to a simple case of exhaustion."

"Indeed." Eduard paused. "And what treatment would you prescribe for such exhaustion, speaking as a physician?"

"Moderation in work, perhaps." Emil kept his tone clinical. "Continued mental engagement. The precise opposite of the bed rest so often prescribed to hysterical women."

"I should caution you, Dr. Králik," Eduard said with a note of sternness, "that another public collapse like yesterday's would make your continued lecturing untenable, regardless of the department's scheduling needs. The students require consistency and strength at the podium."

Emil inclined his head slightly, acknowledging the warning. "A valid concern, sir."

Eduard nodded slowly. "The upcoming research trip with Dr. Schäfer might provide both engagement and a change of environment. Fresh country air has medicinal properties, according to traditional wisdom."

"I quite agree." Emil seized the opening. "The research schedule would provide structure without excessive demands. A perfect compromise."

A moment of silence stretched between them as Eduard considered. The institutional pragmatism of maintaining the research schedule battled visibly with his medical concern. Finally, he nodded.

"Very well." The words came with the weight of official approval. Then, his voice softening slightly: "But I expect daily reports on the findings. And Emil—" the use of his given name now unmistakably significant, "Gull also noted that 'the best of all remedies is a warm bed.' Do make use of one occasionally."

Emil allowed a professionally appropriate smile. "I shall endeavor to remember that wisdom, Herr Doktor." The deliberate return to formality served as gentle resistance to Eduard's momentary concern.

As he rose to leave, he calculated the victory. Eduard's concern had been pacified, if not entirely dismissed. The research trip would proceed as planned. And most importantly, his carefully constructed routines would remain intact.

But as he reached the door, Eduard's voice stopped him. 

"One more thing, Dr. Králik. Do you recall Gull's views on clinical observation?"

Emil turned. "He had many."

"'Study the hindrances, acquaint yourself with the causes which have led up to the disease. Don't guess at them, but know them through and through if you can.'" Eduard recited the words without referring to any text, his eyes never leaving Emil's face. "I have always found that particular wisdom invaluable. It reminds us that true diagnosis requires patience, thoroughness, and the willingness to look beyond the obvious explanation."

The words hung in the air between them, freighted with meaning. Eduard's carefully chosen quotation suggested not just medical philosophy but a warning – that he would continue to observe, to gather evidence, to seek the true cause of Emil's condition. The clinical language provided plausible deniability, but the message was unmistakable: this matter was not closed.

For a brief moment, their eyes met in perfect understanding – Eduard's knowledge and Emil's awareness of that knowledge both acknowledged and simultaneously denied. Then Emil nodded politely and stepped into the hallway, closing the door behind him.

The battle was won, but the war of observation had only just begun.



# Emil's Internal Monologue: After Eduard's Office

Emil closed the door to Eduard's office with precisely the correct pressure—not so firm as to suggest agitation, not so gentle as to imply weakness. He maintained his measured stride down the corridor, nodding professionally to a passing colleague, his face a careful composition of academic preoccupation.

It was only when he reached the empty stairwell that his thoughts began to fracture.

*Gull's observations on nervous conditions.* Eduard's words replayed with alarming precision in his mind. Had he actually mentioned anorexia nervosa specifically? Emil couldn't be certain. Perhaps it had been a general reference to nervous ailments. Perhaps he had only imagined the implication.

He descended the stairs at a deliberate pace, counting each step silently.

Seventeen. Eighteen. Nineteen.

This was absurd. One fainting spell and suddenly he was imagining himself diagnosed with a condition reserved for fragile, emotional women? Eduard was far too rational for such a leap. The very idea was laughable.

*A well-fed brain sleeps well.*

Emil's hand tightened on the banister. The quotation had been deliberate, of course—Eduard never spoke without purpose. But it hardly constituted a diagnosis. At most, it suggested concern about overwork, perhaps poor nutrition. Nothing more specific than that.

*The human body, regardless of sex, operates under certain immutable principles.*

He reached the landing and paused, calculating his route through the building. The main corridor would be crowded with students at this hour. The east passage would be quieter but would add forty-three steps to his journey. The additional expenditure was acceptable. Necessary, even, after yesterday's incident.

As he turned toward the east passage, his mind circled back to the scales. His own was safely hidden behind the privacy screen in his apartment—an apartment he was now forbidden to occupy alone. Felix's insistence on this "protective measure" was the most immediate problem. How would he maintain precise measurement without access to his carefully calibrated instrument?

The thought sent a ripple of something cold through his chest.

He could, perhaps, memorize the precise measurements of certain clothing items before departing. The gap between waistcoat and shirt, for instance. The notch on his belt. These would serve as crude approximations. But without numerical precision, how could he maintain proper control?

*We presumed you were still insensate—*

Emil had interrupted Eduard there, but the meaning was clear enough. Eduard and the university physician had been discussing his condition while they believed him unconscious. What conclusions had they reached in that unguarded conversation? What observations had they shared?

He quickened his pace slightly, then immediately corrected himself. Additional expenditure must be carefully regulated.

And now the countryside expedition loomed as yet another complication. Not Felix's estate but an unfamiliar location, with unknown variables and limited privacy. Worse still was Felix's declaration that he would "not pretend." The words echoed uncomfortably in Emil's mind. Felix would not maintain the polite fiction that nothing was amiss. He would question, observe, challenge.

This would require a more sophisticated strategy. Not merely concealment but active misdirection. A careful balance of apparent compliance and actual control.

Was it possible Eduard had already spoken with Felix? The thought arrived with unexpected force. What if the country expedition had been conceived as some form of collaborative intervention? What if his carefully constructed routines were already being dismantled by well-meaning colleagues?

No. If that were the case, Eduard would not have permitted him to continue lecturing. Professional standards would have demanded immediate medical leave.

*Another public collapse like yesterday's would make your continued lecturing untenable.*

The warning had been clear enough.

Emil paused at the junction of two corridors, ostensibly to consult his pocket watch. Twenty-six minutes until his next lecture. The calculation was automatic: fourteen minutes to review notes, seven minutes to prepare the demonstration materials, five minutes for unanticipated delays.

This was manageable. This was orderly. This was within his control.

The brief interaction with Eduard had been nothing more than professional concern, easily managed through reasonable explanation. If his mentor had truly suspected anorexia nervosa, he would have been obligated to request a physical examination, perhaps even consultation with another physician. The fact that he had not done so confirmed Emil's assessment—this was merely about fatigue and overwork.

*One little dizzy spell and you fancy yourself a wasting waif.* He scoffed internally at the thought.

He reached his office door and unlocked it with steady hands. Once inside, he moved directly to his desk, retrieving the leather-bound notebook from his inner pocket. Opening to yesterday's notes, he examined what he had written before losing consciousness.

The handwriting deteriorated noticeably toward the final lines, becoming jagged and irregular where his usual script was precise. Unconscious documentation of his fading awareness. Scientifically interesting, if somewhat unsettling.

The last legible notation read: "Progressive visual narrowing consistent with circulatory insufficiency. Possible vagal response to—"

The sentence remained unfinished, trailing into an illegible scrawl.

Emil closed the notebook carefully. A convenient coincidence that his observations had halted before any potentially revealing conclusions. The vagal response could have multiple causes—standing too quickly, overheated laboratory conditions, insufficient hydration.

Still, the notebook entry created a new set of calculations. The handwriting degradation suggested approximately seventeen seconds between initial symptom recognition and loss of consciousness. Factoring in delayed recognition, perhaps twenty-five seconds total. This was valuable data. Next time, he would know precisely how long he had to reach a chair or other suitable position before collapse.

Next time. The phrase echoed uncomfortably.

There could be no next time. Eduard had made that clear. Another such incident would jeopardize his position.

Emil glanced at the small calendar on his desk. The expedition would begin in eleven days. Between now and then, he would need to maintain absolute control. No further incidents. No cause for additional concern.

And Felix. That would be the true challenge. Felix with his direct gaze and refusal to engage in social niceties. Felix who had already declared his intention to confront rather than accommodate. Felix who had witnessed—what? Emil wasn't entirely certain how much his colleague had observed before and during his collapse.

Worse still was the knowledge that someone—this Protégé character Felix had mentioned—had apparently been watching him sleep. The violation was profound, yet somehow abstract compared to the more immediate concern of Felix's surveillance. At least the Protégé had merely observed. Felix would undoubtedly attempt to intervene.

He would require a comprehensive plan for maintaining his regimen without triggering Felix's now-heightened awareness. Perhaps a strategic concession here and there—an extra morsel consumed in plain view, a slightly longer rest period accepted with good grace—to mask the broader pattern of control.

The challenge was not unwelcome. Structure and careful planning had always been his strengths.

Emil smoothed down his waistcoat, fingers automatically checking the precise distance between button and fabric edge. Still correct. Still controlled.

For a brief, intrusive moment, he wondered what Sir William Gull would have made of him. Would the great physician have seen through his careful management, his meticulous calculations? Would he have recognized in Emil what he had observed in those young women?

Impossible to know. And irrelevant besides.

Emil opened his lecture notes with deliberate precision. Eduard's concern had been addressed. The academic calendar would proceed as planned. His routines remained intact, if somewhat modified by circumstances.

Everything was precisely as it should be.

He ignored the faint tremor in his hands as he arranged his papers, attributing it to the morning's insufficient coffee rather than the gnawing emptiness below his ribs.

Control. Order. Precision.

These were the only diagnosis that mattered.
