2. Felix's Sketching of Emil
University library, late afternoon
Felix's pencil moved across the paper with practiced fluidity, capturing Emil as he bent over a medical text at the opposite table. The library's amber light caught the sharp angles of Emil's face, the hollow beneath his cheekbones casting shadows that Felix's pencil translated into delicate shading.
He'd been sketching Emil for years now—enough drawings to document the gradual transformation of his friend's form. The early sketches showed a slender but solid young man; the current ones revealed something more sculpted by absence than presence.
Emil remained unaware of his observation, absorbed in his reading, one hand unconsciously tracing his collar where it hung loose around his neck. Felix captured this gesture too, the telling detail of a man monitoring his own disappearance.
These sketches remained private, filed away in Felix's portfolio—a visual medical record neither of them acknowledged. Felix sometimes wondered if Emil knew, if he recognized himself in the occasional drawings Felix did share. But that conversation remained in the realm of unspoken things between them, like so much else.
The library clock chimed five, and Emil looked up, catching Felix's gaze. Felix smoothly turned the page, shifting to architectural notes without breaking rhythm.
"Dinner at Café Imperial?" Felix suggested casually.
"Perhaps," Emil replied, the familiar dance of proposal and evasion beginning again.

Felix continued his architectural sketches, but his attention remained on Emil. He could read the calculations happening behind his friend's eyes—the mental review of today's intake, the projected expenditure of energy required for dinner, the formulation of a plausible excuse.
"They have excellent clear soups," Felix added, as if this were merely a culinary observation rather than a careful negotiation. He had learned which offerings might be acceptable, which would be refused.
Emil's fingers tapped a precise rhythm on the book cover. "I have notes to complete before tomorrow's lecture."
"Bring them along," Felix suggested, adding details to the cornice he was sketching. "I need to finish these elevation drawings. We can work together."
This was their pattern now—Felix never directly insisting, simply creating spaces where Emil's refusals would require more effort than acceptance. Sometimes it worked.
Emil hesitated, then nodded slightly. "For an hour, perhaps."
Felix continued sketching, keeping his satisfaction hidden. The drawing of Emil would be completed later, from memory—another addition to the chronological record he kept. The earliest sketches from their university days showed a different man entirely: cheeks fuller, shoulders more substantial, eyes less hollow. Felix had dozens of these unofficial medical records, a visual documentation of Emil's slow disappearance.
Sometimes he wondered if he should show them to Eduard Weber or another medical authority, breaking the silent pact of observation that defined their friendship. But each time he contemplated this betrayal, he imagined Emil's response—the shuttering of that already guarded face, the severing of their connection. So the sketches remained private, their existence unacknowledged, even as they multiplied.
"Shall we go?" Emil asked, already gathering his papers with efficient movements.
Felix closed his sketchbook, the architectural drawings visible but the earlier portrait of Emil hidden beneath them. "After you," he said, sliding the visual evidence of his concern into his satchel alongside his other secrets.
