Coffee House Morning Ritual
Eight-fifteen. The wall clock at Café Imperial confirmed the precision of Emil's pocket watch. He selected a table positioned exactly between the tiled wall and the central pillar—a location that provided both visibility of the entrance and limited exposure to passing waiters with their inevitable offerings of pastries.
The morning routine required careful calibration. Arrival at eight-fifteen ensured Emil would be seated and settled before Felix's habitual entrance at eight-twenty-three, providing enough time to establish presence without the extended social obligation that arriving earlier would necessitate.
"Coffee, black," Emil informed the waiter, adding in a practiced tone, "Nothing else. I've already taken breakfast."
The lie emerged with the smoothness of a well-rehearsed medical recitation. In truth, his morning had consisted of precisely thirty minutes of walking followed by a careful recording of his weight: 58.4 kilograms, a reduction of 0.2 from yesterday. The measurement had been documented in his journal using his personal notation system before being translated into more obscure shorthand in his pocket notebook.
Emil positioned his notebook beside the empty coffee cup, arranging his pencil at precisely the correct angle for note-taking. The activity of writing provided both justification for his presence and protection against unwanted offerings of food.
The café operated with the steady rhythm of clockwork. Regular patrons moved through their established patterns: the law clerk who consumed exactly two cream-filled pastries while reading the legal notices, the elderly gentleman who arrived at quarter to eight and departed at half past with military precision, the medical students who clustered around the corner table with their textbooks and nervous laughter.
"Good morning!" Felix's voice preceded his physical presence by precisely 1.3 seconds. "Splendid weather for the walk over."
Felix unwound his scarf and deposited himself in the chair opposite Emil's with a fluid motion that displayed no awareness of its own grace. His sketch pad emerged from his satchel in the same practiced movement he had been executing since their university days.
"I ordered only coffee," Emil said, a statement that served both as information and preemptive defense.
"I should hope so at this hour. My stomach requires proper attention before facing Professor Weber's interminable committee meeting." Felix signaled to the waiter with a casual gesture. "Coffee with cream, two eggs, ham, and whatever pastries were made most recently."
Emil calculated the approximate caloric value—between 700 and 850, depending on preparation methods—while maintaining an expression of professional interest. The notebook provided a focus for his gaze, preventing extended observation of Felix's natural consumption of food that would appear conspicuous.
"You've received the notice regarding Thursday's faculty presentation?" Emil inquired, transitioning to safer territory.
"Indeed. Another opportunity to display our collective ignorance before the Department Chair." Felix's pencil moved across his sketch pad in absent strokes, capturing the architectural details of the ceiling while his attention remained on the conversation.
The coffee arrived. Emil noted the time—eight twenty-seven—and lifted the cup with a deliberate steadiness that concealed the morning tremor in his right hand. The bitter liquid represented approximately 5 calories, negligible in his daily calculations, though the warmth would accelerate his heart rate by an estimated 3-4 beats per minute for the next thirty minutes.
"The museum committee has requested another consultation," Felix continued, his gaze shifting between his sketch pad and Emil's face. "The Collector's bequest continues to generate administrative headaches."
"Items of medical interest?" Emil maintained professional curiosity while discreetly pressing his fingertips against his radial artery beneath the table's edge. Pulse: 76. Elevated but within acceptable parameters.
"Primarily architectural documentation, though there's a curious collection of medical illustrations that might interest you. Anatomical studies with peculiar annotation systems."
Felix's breakfast arrived in staggered portions: first coffee, then eggs and ham, finally the pastries. He consumed each with an unself-conscious appreciation that Emil observed through carefully timed glances. The efficiency with which Felix alternated between eating, sketching, and conversing suggested no internal calculations, no awareness of the precise caloric values entering his system.
Movement at the entrance drew Emil's attention. Eight-forty. Three men entered carrying a fourth—no, a woman—her form so delicate she appeared to require minimal effort to transport. Klara. Her arrival at the café occurred only on Tuesdays and Fridays, according to Emil's observation log.
"Our ethereal friend makes her appearance," Felix noted, his pencil shifting to capture her arrangement in the chair by the window, her attendants positioning her limbs with practiced care.
Emil watched the ritual with clinical interest. Klara's condition—partial paralysis of uncertain origin—represented a medical curiosity, yet her self-imposed dietary restrictions mirrored aspects of his own regimen. Her fragility served a dual purpose: necessitating her transportation by admirers while reinforcing her ethereal artistic persona.
"She's lost weight since December," Emil observed, the assessment automatic and detached.
"As have you," Felix replied without looking up from his sketch. The comment landed with the casual precision of a surgeon's blade, neither accusation nor concern but simple observation.
Emil's fingers tightened imperceptibly around his coffee cup. His pulse increased to approximately 84 beats per minute. He made a mental note to extend his evening walk by fifteen minutes to compensate for the coffee and associated cardiovascular response.
"The laboratory schedule requires adjustments to meal timing," he replied, the prepared explanation emerging with clinical detachment.
"Of course." Felix continued sketching, his attention now focused on capturing Klara's delicate profile against the window light. "Though I've observed your laboratory schedule has required such adjustments with increasing frequency these past months."
The statement hung between them, neither question nor accusation. Emil calculated possible responses, each weighted for plausibility and minimum defensive implication.
"Research demands create irregular patterns," he finally replied, the neutral phrasing carefully practiced.
Felix nodded without looking up from his sketch. His breakfast remained half-finished, abandoned for the more pressing interest of capturing Klara's arrangement by the window. Emil noted with satisfaction that the conversation had shifted away from his own habits.
Nine o'clock. The café had reached its morning capacity. Conversations merged into a steady murmur punctuated by the precise sounds of porcelain against porcelain, silver against plate. Emil completed his coffee, the empty cup providing evidence of consumption while representing minimal caloric intake.
"I have a lecture at ten," Emil announced, gathering his notebook with measured movements.
"And I have buildings to preserve while Weber pontificates on funding allocations." Felix tore the completed sketch from his pad and slid it across the table. "For your collection."
The drawing captured Emil in profile, bent over his notebook. The precision of detail revealed uncomfortable truths: the sharpness of cheekbones, the hollow beneath his eyes, the careful way he held himself. Felix's sketches always contained this unsettling accuracy—a medical documentation more precise than Emil's own journals.
"Your technique continues to improve," Emil said, folding the sketch into his notebook with practiced indifference. He would examine it later, measuring the visible changes against his documented weight fluctuations.
"Coffee on Thursday?" Felix asked, returning to his abandoned breakfast.
"Thursday," Emil confirmed, calculating that the four-day interval would prevent patterns of observation from forming while maintaining necessary social obligations.
He stood, his body responding with the minor lightheadedness he had come to anticipate. Three seconds of stability required before walking. The physical response timed and categorized, neither concerning nor unexpected.
Outside, morning sunlight measured precise angles against Prague's architecture. Emil calculated his walking route for maximum efficiency—university offices via Karlova Street, 1.7 kilometers, approximately 70 calories expended. The numbers brought familiar comfort as he stepped into the rhythm of the city, leaving Felix to his untroubled consumption of pastries and coffee.
