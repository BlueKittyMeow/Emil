Eduard Weber Observes Emil
University corridor, after a lecture
Professor Eduard Weber watched his former student from the doorway of the lecture hall. Emil Králik had just delivered a brilliant lecture on anesthetic compounds, his technical precision impeccable despite hands that trembled slightly when pointing to the chemical diagrams.
Weber had been observing the young doctor for weeks now, noting the increasingly concerning patterns—the collar that no longer fit, the waistcoats adjusted beyond reasonable tailoring, the careful avoidance of the faculty dining room.
The symptoms aligned with cases he had documented early in his career, though primarily in young women. The rarity of male presentation made Emil's case both professionally fascinating and personally alarming.
"A remarkable lecture, Dr. Králik," Weber said, approaching as students filed out.
Emil straightened, his professional mask immediately in place. "Professor Weber. Thank you for attending."
"Your research is progressing well. Perhaps we could discuss it over lunch?"
The slight tightening around Emil's eyes was nearly imperceptible. "Unfortunately, I must return to the laboratory. Time-sensitive experiments."
Weber nodded, noting the familiar evasion. "Another time, then."
As Emil gathered his papers, Weber observed the careful conservation of movement, the unconscious calculation behind each gesture. He would need to intervene soon, but direct confrontation would only drive his former student further into denial.
Perhaps approaching Emil's friend, the architect, might provide an alternative avenue.
