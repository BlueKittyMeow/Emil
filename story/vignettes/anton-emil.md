Anton's Concern for Emil
Anton's grocery, early morning
Anton Svoboda arranged the fresh produce as the first light of dawn filtered through his shop windows. Tuesday meant Dr. Králik would stop by for his "weekly groceries"—though Anton had long ago realized the young doctor purchased barely enough to keep a bird alive.
When the bell above the door chimed at precisely six thirty, Anton was ready with the items Dr. Králik invariably requested: a small loaf of dark bread, a quarter-pound of the least fatty cheese, and a pint of clear broth.
"Good morning, Pan Doktor," Anton greeted in Czech, noting the doctor's increasing thinness with practiced discretion. "Fresh bread this morning."
"Thank you, Anton," Emil replied in their shared native tongue, his Czech more relaxed than his professional German. "Just the usual, please."
Anton carefully wrapped the bread, adding an extra slice when Emil glanced away. "My wife asked after you. She worries, you know."
A shadow crossed Emil's face. "There's no need for concern. My schedule is simply demanding."
"Of course." Anton hesitated, then added a small package alongside the bread. "She sent these plum dumplings for you. A gift, no charge."
Emil stared at the package as if it were a complicated medical specimen. "That's very kind, but—"
"Please," Anton said gently. "She'll ask if you took them."
For a moment, Anton glimpsed something vulnerable beneath the doctor's composed exterior—a young Czech boy rather than the German-speaking professional. Then Emil carefully placed the dumplings in his bag.
"Děkuji," Emil said softly. Thank you.
Anton watched him leave, wondering if the dumplings would be eaten or disposed of. He suspected the latter, but would continue the quiet battle regardless. The doctor might speak German in his professional life, but Anton recognized the particular suffering of their shared people, whatever form it took.
