Felix's apartment, after Emil had nearly collapsed during a walk to view historic buildings
Felix guided Emil to a chair, concern evident. "You should rest. I have water here."
"How fortunate," Emil said, his voice taut with embarrassment, "that I collapsed in the presence of Prague's foremost specialist in rescuing decrepit Czech edifices."
Felix paused, water glass halfway extended, before understanding dawned. A smile broke through his concern. "Some structures require more delicate restoration than others. The most valuable ones particularly so."
Emil accepted the water, grateful for Felix's willingness to engage the joke rather than press with concern. "I assure you, this particular edifice requires no intervention."
"Of course not," Felix replied, settling across from him. "I'm merely documenting for historical purposes."
