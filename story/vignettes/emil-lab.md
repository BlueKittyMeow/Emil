The laboratory afternoon proceeded with mechanical precision. Emil's measurements of the chloroform solution required exactitude—the difference between effective sedation and respiratory arrest measured in droplets. His hands should have been steady, the instruments extensions of his will rather than objects manipulated by increasingly unreliable flesh.
The first warning came as a slight tremor in his right hand, barely perceptible but noted with clinical detachment. The second manifestation announced itself as a momentary graying of his peripheral vision. Emil continued his work, compensating through force of will, his attention divided between the measurement and the monitoring of his own physiological state.
The glass vial slipped from his fingers with a sudden betrayal of muscle control. It shattered against the laboratory floor, its contents immediately vaporizing in the warm room. The sweet, cloying scent of chloroform rose around him like a spectre.
Emil stepped backward, calculating the air volume of the laboratory, the concentration of the spilled solution, the ventilation parameters. His professional mind continued functioning while his body responded to both the chemical exposure and his diminished reserves. The combination proved unsustainable.
He reached for the workbench but found only air as the laboratory tilted unexpectedly. His vision tunneled, the precise instruments and careful notes receding as if viewed through the wrong end of a telescope.
When consciousness returned, Emil found himself sprawled on the laboratory floor, the shattered glass mere centimeters from his face. The chloroform scent had dissipated somewhat, though its chemical sweetness lingered. His pocket watch, retrieved with effort, indicated seventeen minutes had passed.
He rose carefully, methodically assessing potential injuries. None appeared significant—a minor cut on his left palm, a developing bruise on his right temple. More concerning was the evidence surrounding him: the broken glass, spilled chemical, the clear indication of a researcher who had lost physical control.
Emil swept the glass fragments into a neat pile, retrieved a dustpan from the supply cabinet, and erased the evidence of his moment of weakness. The inventory ledger would require adjustment to account for the lost chloroform. Perhaps "experimental miscalculation" would suffice as explanation.
As he completed the cleanup, the laboratory door opened without warning. Emil straightened immediately, assuming the posture of a researcher interrupted during routine work.
"Dr. Králik." Professor Weber paused in the doorway, his gaze moving from Emil to the freshly swept floor. "I wasn't aware you were conducting experiments today."
"A simple preparation for tomorrow's demonstration," Emil replied, his voice modulated to convey appropriate professional enthusiasm. "The students benefit from visual understanding of anesthetic properties."
"Indeed." Weber's eyes narrowed slightly. "The laboratory ventilation appears inadequate. Your face is quite pale."
"Perhaps you're right. I'll open a window."
Weber nodded and departed, his footsteps echoing in the corridor. Emil's hand trembled once more as he reached for the window latch, the afternoon light illuminating the thin skin stretched over prominent veins.
