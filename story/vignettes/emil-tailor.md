Note: fix issue with pinning and leaving the clothes, not leaving WITH them. 

Rain fell against the shop windows in relentless vertical sheets, the evening light already fading though it was barely half-past four. Emil stood on the worn fitting platform, arms extended at precise forty-five-degree angles while Herr Mahler, the tailor, worked around him with measuring tape and pins. The small shop smelled of wool, beeswax, and the peculiar dampness that permeated Prague during November rains.
"If you would lower your left arm now, Dr. Králik," Mahler said, his voice maintaining professional neutrality though Emil detected the subtle strain beneath. The tailor's fingers, calloused from decades of needlework, manipulated the fabric of Emil's waistcoat with practiced precision.
Emil complied, calculating the energy expenditure of maintaining the posture against the caloric reserves remaining from the morning's deliberately measured quarter-cup of clear broth. The balance appeared adequate for the appointment's expected duration.
Mahler's apprentice, a thin boy of perhaps sixteen, stood ready with pins on a worn velvet cushion, his eyes carefully averted from Emil's form. The boy had been present during Emil's previous fitting—had it only been twenty-seven days ago?—and Emil noted the careful neutrality in the apprentice's expression. Professional training, clearly.
"I find myself puzzled, Doctor," Mahler said after several moments of work, "by the considerable adjustment required so shortly after our previous alterations."
The tailor's tone remained carefully modulated, but Emil recognized the underlying question. This represented the third consecutive month requiring significant modification to his wardrobe. Such frequency deviated from expected patterns in Mahler's professional experience.
"Research demands certain sacrifices," Emil replied, selecting an explanation that offered partial truth without unnecessary detail. "The current experimental protocols require extended hours. I find myself frequently substituting intellectual engagement for regular meals."
Mahler nodded without looking up from his work, his fingers continuing their precise manipulations of fabric. "The waistcoat will require significant adjustment at the back. The current side straps have reached their limit."
The implied professional criticism registered in Emil's awareness but carried no weight against the satisfaction of necessary progress. The side straps, with their three-position adjustments, had indeed been fully utilized. The need for complete restructuring represented measurable advancement.
"The jacket shoulders," Mahler continued, turning Emil with gentle pressure against his upper arm, "will need to be completely refitted. The current padding has become..." he hesitated, selecting his words with obvious care, "disproportionate to the underlying structure."
Emil noted the tailor's diplomatic phrasing with clinical appreciation. Mahler had maintained a professional practice for over thirty years, catering to Prague's academic and professional classes. His discretion represented a business necessity rather than personal consideration.
The apprentice approached with additional pins as Mahler worked, the boy's eyes briefly meeting Emil's before darting away. Something in that momentary contact suggested an emotion Emil couldn't immediately categorize—not quite fear, not precisely concern, but a quality that registered as significant nonetheless.
"The trousers," Mahler said, his voice lowered slightly though no other customers occupied the shop at this late hour, "will require complete reconstruction rather than simple adjustment. Perhaps a different style might better accommodate your current proportions."
Emil understood the professional suggestion contained within this observation. Mahler was proposing a silhouette that would disguise rather than reveal the body's architectural development. The suggestion, while well-intentioned, contradicted the experiment's documentation requirements.
"I prefer consistency in cut," Emil replied. "The standard style remains appropriate for professional settings."
Mahler nodded, though his expression suggested unvoiced reservation. He made several notations in a small leather-bound book, using a personalized shorthand that Emil, despite his educated status, couldn't decipher.
As the tailor worked at the trouser adjustments, Emil's gaze drifted to the shop's small mirror positioned for customer evaluations. The glass, somewhat warped with age, reflected a fragmented image partially obscured by Mahler's form. The visible elements—a shoulder, the angle of a jaw, the suggestion of a collar against pale skin—appeared to Emil as promising indications of structural refinement.
The rain intensified against the windows, street lamps now fully illuminated against the early darkness. Emil calculated the energy requirements for the walk home in such conditions, factoring the additional weight of rain-soaked clothing and the resistance of wind. The ledger balanced, but with minimal reserves.
"Your coat, Doctor," Mahler said, interrupting Emil's calculations. "I must express professional concern regarding its adequacy for current conditions. Perhaps a style with additional insulating properties might be advisable for the winter months."
The suggestion carried implications beyond tailoring. Emil recognized the medical assessment disguised as professional advice. Mahler had clothed enough physicians over decades to absorb certain observational skills.
"The walking distance is minimal," Emil replied, dismissing the concern with professional authority. "Physical activity generates adequate thermal regulation."
Mahler's expression remained carefully neutral as he made final adjustments. "The alterations will require seven days, possibly eight given the extent of reconstruction necessary. I would suggest leaving the gray suit as well, as its condition appears similar."
Emil nodded agreement. The gray suit had indeed become similarly inconsistent with current measurements. The experiment's progress continued to exceed initial projections, a satisfying indication of methodological efficacy.
The final measurements completed, Emil redressed in his temporarily pinned clothing. The apprentice assisted with his coat, the boy's hands briefly touching Emil's shoulders through the layers of fabric. Something in the contact suggested unusual gentleness, as if handling fragile material requiring special care.
"Weather such as this demands particular attention to health, Doctor," Mahler said as he recorded the final measurements in his book. "Especially for gentlemen of medical knowledge who understand winter's effects on... physically refined constitutions."
The implicit medical advice registered clearly despite its careful phrasing. Emil found himself calculating the frequency with which tailors might observe physical deterioration in clients—perhaps certain medical conditions revealed themselves first in fitting rooms rather than examination offices.
"Professional responsibilities demand attention regardless of atmospheric conditions," Emil replied, selecting coins from his wallet with precise fingers. His hand paused momentarily above the counter as a slight tremor manifested, the momentary muscle instability carefully concealed by transitioning the gesture into a deliberate placement of payment.
Mahler appeared not to notice the adjustment, though the apprentice's eyes flickered briefly toward the motion before returning to his assigned task of gathering discarded pins.
"Will there be anything else, Doctor?" Mahler asked, completing the transaction with professional efficiency.
Emil considered the question's multiple dimensions. The immediate reference to additional services balanced against the underlying inquiry regarding physical wellbeing. The tailor's position represented an interesting liminal space between tradesman and confidant—privileged to observe physical evidence unavailable to most observers, yet constrained by social position from direct inquiry.
"Nothing additional at present," Emil replied, gathering his umbrella from the stand near the door. "Though I anticipate returning within approximately thirty days for evaluation of these adjustments."
Something shifted in Mahler's expression—a subtle recalculation that Emil recognized from academic colleagues when confronted with unexpected experimental results. The tailor recovered quickly, professional mask returning.
"Perhaps," Mahler said carefully, "a slightly longer interval might be advisable. Allowing for seasonal fluctuations and the completion of your current research phase."
The suggestion contained multiple encoded messages: professional concern, business calculation, and subtle medical advice. Emil categorized these elements with clinical precision while dismissing their relevance to experimental protocols.
"Science operates on its own timeline, Herr Mahler," he replied, opening the shop door to the sound of intensified rainfall. "As does the body's response to intellectual demands. I bid you good evening."
The cold rain struck immediately, soaking through the inadequately adjusted coat within moments. Emil calculated the precise route home, factoring wind resistance and energy conservation. The slight lightheadedness registered as data rather than warning—simply another measurement in the ongoing experiment.
Behind him, through the rain-streaked glass, the tailor and apprentice exchanged a glance that contained unspoken concerns. Emil noted the interaction without interpretation, his mind already documenting the day's measurements for later transcription into his research journal.
The rain continued its methodical assault as Emil walked with careful precision through streets illuminated by the blurred halos of gas lamps. Each step represented both progress and expenditure, carefully balanced in the ledger of transformation that consumed his awareness with scientific certainty.
