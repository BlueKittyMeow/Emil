The Sketch Critique Scene
Felix's apartment, evening, rain against windows
The rain had persisted since morning, the steady rhythm against Felix's windows creating a comfortable isolation from the rest of Prague. Emil had arrived damp despite his umbrella, and now sat near the coal stove with a cup of tea he had barely touched.
Felix worked at his drawing table, the lamp creating a pool of amber light over several sketches. He had been organizing his portfolio—architectural studies, historical building details, and the occasional figure drawing. Emil glanced over occasionally, his attention caught by Felix's methodical sorting.
"This might interest you," Felix said, selecting a sketch and bringing it to where Emil sat. "The Klementinum library. I'm documenting the interior details for the restoration committee."
Emil examined the drawing with professional attention. Felix had captured the baroque splendor of the ceiling with remarkable precision, the architectural details rendered with both technical accuracy and artistic appreciation.
"Your eye for detail is impressive," Emil said, handing the sketch back.
Felix returned to his table, casually setting aside several other drawings before pausing at one particular sketch. He studied it briefly before turning back to Emil.
"I forgot I had this one," he said, his tone deliberately light. "From the medical society lecture last month."
He offered the drawing to Emil, who accepted it with the same clinical detachment he had shown the architectural sketch. But his expression shifted subtly as he recognized himself at the podium, captured in Felix's precise lines.
Emil studied the image with the same careful attention he might give a medical specimen. Felix had drawn him in profile, his focus on his notes, one hand raised to emphasize a point. The proportions were accurate, the posture characteristic, but something in the rendering made Emil's brow furrow slightly.
"You've made me look far too thin," Emil said, his tone carefully neutral despite the complex calculation happening behind his eyes.
Felix leaned against his drawing table, arms folded casually. "That's precisely how you appeared."
"Surely not," Emil replied, studying the sketch again. "The perspective must have created a distortion."
"I draw what I see," Felix said simply. "My architectural work requires accurate proportion."
Emil's fingers traced the outline of the figure—the sharp angle of the jawline, the hollow beneath the cheekbone, the space visible between neck and collar. His expression remained unreadable, caught between hoping Felix was wrong and needing him to be right.
"You've always had a tendency toward the dramatic in your figure studies," Emil said, attempting to sound amused rather than defensive.
Felix took the sketch back, examining it with professional objectivity. "I could compare it with earlier sketches if you wish. I have several from university days."
A barely perceptible tension appeared in Emil's shoulders. "That's hardly necessary."
Felix returned the sketch to his portfolio without comment, but his eyes remained on Emil, seeing both the physical changes and the careful denial. The rain continued against the windows, filling the silence between them.
"Another cup of tea?" Felix offered, knowing it would likely remain untouched like the first.
"No, thank you," Emil replied, already standing. "I should review my notes for tomorrow's lecture."
Felix nodded, not pressing the issue. "Of course."
As Emil gathered his papers, Felix returned to organizing his sketches, including the one of Emil among the others—one more document in the visual record he kept. Both men maintained the fiction that nothing significant had happened, that no boundaries had been approached.
The rain would continue all night, Felix knew. He would complete another sketch of Emil from memory after his friend left—one more image in the chronological documentation of Emil's gradual disappearance.
"I'll walk with you to the university tomorrow if the rain stops," Felix said as Emil prepared to leave.
"If you wish," Emil replied, the familiar dance of care and distance continuing between them.
After Emil departed, Felix retrieved the sketch again, studying the figure he had drawn with an artist's precision. He had not exaggerated the thinness—if anything, he had slightly softened the reality. The drawings from their university days showed a different man entirely, the transformation documented in dozens of sketches Felix had created over the years.
He returned the sketch to its place in the chronological collection, each image a record of Emil's slow fading, visible to Felix's artist eye but impossible to address directly between them.
