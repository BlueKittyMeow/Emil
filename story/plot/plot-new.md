Reichmann's Suspicious Death
The Anesthesiologist Connection
Emil's expertise creates the perfect plot device:

Reichmann died of apparent heart failure/stroke at 58
No autopsy was performed as the death appeared natural
Later, Emil reviews casual notes about the death and notices suspicious elements:

Possible Poison Scenario:

Chloroform derivatives that cause cardiac arrhythmia when administered carefully
Symptoms resembling natural heart failure
No obvious smell or evidence remaining after death
Requires medical knowledge to administer correctly
Could be introduced through regular medication
Emil would recognize the pattern from research cases

The Investigation Element

Emil initially dismisses his suspicion as professional overanalysis
Later discovers Reichmann was taking heart medication regularly
Medication could mask or be vehicle for poison
The elderly associate mentions Reichmann complained of "unusual symptoms" before death
Emil connects these symptoms to chloroform derivative poisoning
Not enough evidence for authorities, but enough for Emil's professional certainty

The Original Trio Dynamic
This moral progression works perfectly:

Initial Collection: Reichmann and the elderly associate begin with genuinely scientific interest
Moral Gray Area: Gradually push boundaries of ethical specimen acquisition
The Protégé Arrives: Attracted by their work, approaches Reichmann
Escalation: Protégé brings increasingly disturbing specimens
Breaking Point: Protégé suggests they preserve their own brains after death
Confrontation: Reichmann threatens to expose everything
Murder: Protégé poisons Reichmann, making it appear natural
Aftermath: Threatens elderly associate, takes key records, disappears

The Letters to Emil
This creates incredible tension and character development:
Progression of Letters

Initial Warning: First letter warns Emil to stop investigating (after country estate visit)
Intimidation: Subsequent letters demonstrate knowledge of Emil's movements
Transition to Interest: Gradual shift as Protégé notes Emil's physical condition

"I couldn't help but observe your remarkable physical discipline during yesterday's lecture..."
"Your collar sits three centimeters from your neck - a precise measurement of dedication..."


Scientific Observation: Letters begin including clinical observations

"Your gait shows the characteristic adaptation to sustained caloric restriction..."
"The tremor in your left hand has increased by approximately 4% since last observation..."


Collection Interest: Final letters reveal intention to add Emil to collection

"Your condition represents the perfect self-directed specimen acquisition..."
"Few subjects maintain such meticulous self-documentation of their own transformation..."



Emil's Reaction

Initially dismisses letters as attempt to frighten him away from investigation
Hides them from Felix out of both pride and protection
As letters become more personal, feels violated yet disturbingly seen
Recognizes clinical accuracy of observations, creating terrible validation
Eventually must show Felix when the threat becomes too explicit
