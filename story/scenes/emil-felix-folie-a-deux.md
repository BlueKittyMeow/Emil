The faculty meeting had concluded fourteen minutes prior, yet the usual clusters of colleagues remained in the department's oak-paneled conference room, engaged in those professional conversations that often proved more consequential than the official agenda. Emil gathered his papers with methodical precision, organizing them by topic and relevance for later transcription into his research journal.
Professor Eduard Weber approached from across the room with deliberate casualness that immediately registered in Emil's awareness as calculated rather than coincidental. The older man had been Emil's doctoral supervisor years earlier, his guidance instrumental in securing Emil's current position. Their relationship had evolved from mentor-student to colleagues, though Weber maintained a certain protective interest that occasionally manifested in professional inquiries that bordered on personal.
"Králik," Weber said, his voice pitched for privacy despite the room's general conversation. "Your research on chloroform administration techniques continues to progress, I understand? The department anticipates your paper with considerable interest."
Emil recognized the approach—professional inquiry as pretext for closer observation. Weber had employed similar strategies with other colleagues whose health or personal circumstances warranted attention without direct confrontation. The technique reflected both professional courtesy and medical calculation.
"The preliminary results suggest promising modifications to current practice," Emil replied, maintaining appropriate professional enthusiasm while organizing his papers into his leather portfolio. "Though certain experimental variables require additional documentation before conclusions can be finalized."
Weber nodded, his eyes—gray and remarkably observant behind wire-rimmed spectacles—conducting a rapid visual assessment that Emil catalogued with scientific detachment. The senior physician's gaze noted Emil's collar (recently adjusted), his waistcoat (third alteration in recent months), and his hands (displaying progressive metacarpal definition).
"I've been meaning to discuss potential applications with you," Weber said, positioning himself precisely as the room began to empty. "Perhaps we might review the preliminary data over coffee? Your observational methodology has always been exceptionally rigorous."
The professional compliment carried genuine appreciation; Weber had consistently valued Emil's documentation protocols even during his doctoral training. Yet beneath this acknowledgment lay the carefully constructed opportunity for extended observation. Emil calculated the energy requirements of such an engagement against his remaining reserves for the day.
"Unfortunately, my schedule includes laboratory preparations that cannot be delayed," Emil replied, selecting an explanation that offered professional necessity rather than personal refusal. "Perhaps later in the week would be more suitable."
Weber's expression shifted subtly—concern briefly visible before professional composure reasserted itself. He extended his hand in the conventional gesture of collegial parting. "Thursday afternoon, then. I look forward to reviewing your methods."
Emil recognized the situation's parameters instantly. The handshake represented not merely social convention but professional opportunity—a diagnostic moment disguised as casual contact. Weber's medical training included exceptional observational skills; a handshake would provide data regarding temperature, muscle tone, tremor presence, and circulatory adequacy.
The calculation occurred in milliseconds: refusing the gesture would confirm Weber's concerns more definitively than any physical evidence the contact might provide. Acceptance represented the more strategic choice despite its diagnostic vulnerability.
Emil extended his hand with carefully modulated pressure. "Thursday at three would be acceptable, assuming no experimental complications arise."
Their hands met, and Emil immediately registered Weber's technique—the seemingly casual greeting executed with precise clinical intention. The older physician's fingers positioned themselves not merely for social contact but professional assessment: index and middle fingers subtly aligned with radial pulse point, thumb applying calculated pressure to assess muscle tone, duration extended two seconds beyond social norm to allow temperature evaluation.
It was, Emil realized, a remarkably efficient examination disguised within social convention—temperature, pulse, muscle tone, and tremor assessment conducted in approximately five seconds of apparently casual contact. Weber's expression revealed nothing, his social mask maintained with the skill of decades in medical practice.
"Excellent," Weber replied, releasing Emil's hand after his assessment completed. "The department's western conference room should provide adequate privacy for detailed discussion."
The meeting location represented another calculated choice—the western room featured exceptional natural light from its large windows, offering optimal visual observation conditions. Weber's strategy displayed both medical thoroughness and professional subtlety.
"Until Thursday, then," Emil said, securing his portfolio with a precision that deliberately concealed the slight tremor he felt building in his right hand—a physiological response to the encounter's energy requirements.
Weber nodded and turned toward another conversation, though Emil noted the careful angle that allowed continued peripheral observation. The senior physician had extracted considerable diagnostic information from their brief interaction—pulse rate, skin temperature, subtle tremor presence, and muscle tone all registered by trained fingers during those seconds of contact.
As Emil departed, he calculated the probable conclusions Weber would derive from this data. The pulse, likely elevated from the stress of awareness, would suggest cardiovascular strain. The skin temperature, naturally reduced in his condition, would indicate potential circulatory compromise. The muscle tone would reveal protein deficiency despite his careful supplementation calculations.

The walk from the faculty building to his laboratory took precisely seven minutes at Emil's calculated pace. The late afternoon light angled through the university's arched windows, creating alternating patterns of illumination and shadow across the polished wood floors of the corridor. Emil measured his steps with unconscious precision, each one representing a specific caloric expenditure in his mental ledger.
He noted with clinical detachment the slight lightheadedness that manifested upon reaching the laboratory door—an expected physiological response given the day's limited intake and the faculty meeting's unexpected extension by twenty-three minutes beyond its scheduled duration. The sensation would pass once he resumed his seated position at the laboratory bench.
Emil opened the door to find his laboratory already occupied. Felix von Rothenberg stood beside the central workbench, his lean frame casually propped against the edge as he sorted through a scattered array of architectural drawings and notes. The unexpected presence disrupted Emil's calculated routine, introducing a variable not accounted for in his energy expenditure projections.
"There you are," Felix said, looking up with a smile that displayed the easy confidence Emil had observed since their university days. "I hope you don't mind. The light is better here than in the archive reading room, and I needed to organize these plans before tomorrow's presentation."
Felix's presence in Emil's laboratory had become an increasingly common occurrence over recent months—a professional courtesy Emil extended despite the disruption to his carefully structured environment. Felix's architectural research occasionally benefitted from the laboratory's exceptional northern light, particularly when examining faded historical documents.
"The faculty meeting ran beyond its scheduled conclusion," Emil replied, placing his portfolio on his desk with precise alignment to the surface edge. "Several colleagues felt compelled to extend their remarks beyond reasonable necessity."
Felix laughed, the sound carrying a natural ease that Emil had always noted with scientific interest. "Academic discourse—where five minutes becomes fifty without anyone noticing." He stretched, the movement displaying the unconscious grace of his physique, shirt pulling slightly against shoulders that maintained natural definition without apparent effort.
Emil observed this movement with clinical detachment, noting the specific muscular architecture visible even through clothing—the ideal structural efficiency his own experimental protocols sought to achieve through more deliberate methods. Felix represented a natural control subject—genetically predisposed to the physical economy Emil pursued through scientific discipline.
"Weber cornered you after the meeting?" Felix asked, returning to his document organization. "I saw him approach as I was leaving. His 'casual' professional inquiries have become rather transparent lately."
The observation confirmed Emil's assessment of Weber's technique becoming increasingly evident to multiple observers. A concerning development that would require strategic management.
"A simple discussion regarding research progress," Emil replied, selecting an explanation that acknowledged the interaction without revealing its diagnostic nature. "He wishes to review methodology on Thursday."
Felix nodded, sorting through his architectural drawings with fingers that displayed natural dexterity without the prominence of underlying structure that Emil's hands had progressively developed. "He's concerned, you know. Several faculty members are, though they maintain professional distance. Weber, at least, has the history with you to justify direct approach."
The statement contained multiple informational elements requiring processing: faculty observation more widespread than previously calculated; professional concern reaching levels that breached traditional boundaries; Felix's awareness of both this concern and its causes. Emil categorized these elements while maintaining his outward professional composure.
"Academic pressure naturally creates periodic fluctuations in personal habits," Emil replied, selecting a justification that offered plausible explanation without specific acknowledgment. "Research intensity occasionally necessitates temporary adjustments to routine."
Felix looked up from his papers, his gaze carrying an unexpected directness. "Is that what you're calling it? 'Temporary adjustments to routine'?"
The question penetrated more precisely than Weber's diagnostic handshake. Emil found himself calculating response options with unusual difficulty, the unexpected confrontation creating a momentary processing delay.
"Scientific terminology provides clarity in all matters," he finally replied, turning toward his laboratory equipment with deliberate focus, creating physical distance from both Felix and the conversation's direction.
Behind him, Felix sighed, the sound containing multiple emotional elements that Emil couldn't immediately categorize. "You know, for someone who documents everything with such precision, you maintain remarkable blind spots in certain areas."
Emil adjusted the position of a glass beaker precisely one centimeter to align with the measuring apparatus beside it, using the motion to conceal the slight tremor that had returned to his right hand. "All experimentation contains potential observational bias. The scientific method acknowledges this limitation."
"Emil." Felix's voice had shifted, the casual tone replaced by something more direct. "When was the last time you actually ate something? Not moved it around on a plate or disposed of it in your napkin—actually consumed food in quantity sufficient for basic function?"
The question's precision created a momentary disruption in Emil's calculated responses. He found himself conducting an actual review of the day's intake: morning tea without sugar or milk, three carefully measured sips of clear broth at midday, approximately thirty milliliters of water during the faculty meeting.
"My nutritional calculations remain adequate for current requirements," he replied, the standard response emerging with practiced ease. "Different physiological systems operate at varying efficiency levels."
Felix pushed himself away from the table in a single fluid motion, his body displaying the unconscious coordination that resulted from naturally maintained homeostasis. He gathered his papers with efficient movements, organizing them into a leather portfolio similar to Emil's though more worn from frequent use.
"You know what the irony is?" Felix said, securing his portfolio with practiced ease. "You're so busy documenting every detail of your condition that you've lost the ability to actually see it. The observer has become blind to precisely what he's observing with such scientific dedication."
Emil maintained his position at the laboratory bench, calculating the energy requirements of turning to face this confrontation against the reserves remaining after the day's expenditures. The balance appeared insufficient for both physical movement and adequate response formulation.
"Scientific objectivity requires emotional distance," he stated, focusing on the precise arrangement of laboratory equipment before him. "Observation without sentiment provides more accurate data."
Felix moved toward the door, papers secured under his arm, his movements carrying the unconscious ease Emil documented in his own progressive loss of unnecessary physical inefficiency. At the threshold, he paused.
"Thursday at three in the western conference room," Felix said, his tone carrying an unfamiliar quality Emil couldn't immediately categorize. "Weber mentioned it as I was leaving. I'll be there as well—professional courtesy among colleagues with shared interests."
The information represented an unexpected variable—Weber had expanded the consultation to include Felix, creating a scenario that would require significantly more complex management. The implications required immediate recalculation of Thursday's strategic approach.
"That seems unnecessary given the technical nature of the methodology review," Emil replied, still not turning from his equipment.
"It's not a methodology review, Emil," Felix said quietly. "It's an intervention. The kind colleagues arrange when professional concern reaches certain thresholds. Weber thought having me there might make it less institutional and more personal. He still believes you might listen to me."
The direct acknowledgment created a momentary processing delay in Emil's response calculation. The scenario's parameters had shifted beyond anticipated boundaries, requiring comprehensive strategic reconsideration.
"I have preparations that require attention," Emil said finally, his voice maintaining professional neutrality despite the information's significance. "We can discuss Weber's concerns at a more appropriate time."
Felix remained at the doorway for precisely five seconds—Emil counted them without turning—before responding. "There's an anatomical specimen in the medical collection," he said, his voice carrying an unusual quality Emil had never documented in their previous interactions. "A skeleton displaying the final stage of your current experiment. Perhaps you should view it before Thursday. At least then one of us would be fully informed about where this particular scientific investigation ultimately leads."
The door closed with unexpected gentleness, the absence of dramatic exit somehow more disruptive than a conventional display of emotion would have been. Emil remained motionless at his workbench, calculating the implications of this new information against the established parameters of his experimental protocols.
Outside, the late afternoon light had shifted to early evening, shadows lengthening across the laboratory floor with measurable progression. Emil documented this observation with his usual precision, categorizing it alongside the day's other data points in the continuously updated ledger of transformation that occupied his scientific awareness with unwavering certainty.

The Failed Escape
Four-seventeen in the morning. Emil had calculated the optimal departure time with scientific precision—early enough to avoid Felix's usual waking hour, late enough for adequate visibility in Prague's early autumn darkness. The floorboards of the guest bedroom in Felix's apartment creaked slightly despite Emil's careful distribution of weight, the sound measuring approximately twelve decibels—likely insufficient to penetrate the closed door of the master bedroom across the hall.
Emil dressed with methodical efficiency, each movement conserving energy while maintaining silence. The twenty-three days since their return from the countryside had created a precarious equilibrium in their shared living arrangement—a temporary situation Felix had insisted upon after Emil's collapse during their final day at the castle archives. The collapse had been a simple miscalculation in energy expenditure against available reserves, exacerbated by the countryside's unexpected physical demands. Nothing requiring the dramatic intervention Felix had orchestrated.
The guest bedroom mirror reflected a figure Emil assessed with clinical satisfaction despite recent setbacks. The countryside trip had resulted in unexpected progress—the walking distances between castle buildings, the reduced meal options, the constant architectural surveys requiring sustained physical activity. Felix had interpreted the resulting physical manifestations as alarming deterioration, but Emil recognized them as experimental advancement temporarily disrupted by his collapse and Felix's subsequent interference.
His clothing hung with mathematical precision from shoulders that displayed increasingly optimal structural definition. Recent adjustments from Herr Mahler had restored proper fit following the gains made during their countryside excursion. Emil noted with satisfaction the clean architectural lines now visible in his facial structure, the elegant hollows beneath his cheekbones, the precise delineation of his jaw. Progress continued despite interruptions.
The leather portfolio containing his research documentation sat prepared on the desk, packed the previous evening to minimize morning movements. Emil secured it with practiced efficiency, calculating the weight against his carrying capacity for the journey to his own apartment, where he would remain undisturbed while formulating an appropriate response to today's scheduled "intervention."
Felix's concern, while professionally motivated, represented unnecessary interference in a controlled experimental protocol. Today's meeting with Weber would undoubtedly include formal medical evaluation thinly disguised as collegial concern. The most efficient strategy was non-attendance, though this would likely trigger more aggressive institutional response. Emil would need to formulate alternative approaches from the security of his own residence.
He secured his pocket watch—four twenty-three—and moved toward the bedroom door with calculated steps. The hinges had been recently oiled, Emil having applied graphite powder three evenings prior under the guise of eliminating an irritating squeak. The door opened in perfect silence, revealing the darkened hallway of Felix's apartment.
Emil proceeded with measured steps, avoiding the three floorboards he had identified as particularly vocal through systematic testing during his residence. The layout of Felix's apartment had become familiar territory—a necessary adaptation to extended cohabitation following their countryside expedition.
The sitting room appeared ahead, illuminated only by faint gray light filtering through partially drawn curtains. Emil paused at the threshold, conducting a visual assessment of the optimal path to the front door. His calculations faltered as unexpected data registered: a human figure occupied the armchair positioned precisely in the path between Emil and the exit.
Felix von Rothenberg sat in perfect stillness, his long frame arranged with unconscious elegance in the chair's confines. He appeared fully dressed despite the hour, the tailored cut of his clothing accentuating the natural architectural efficiency of his physique. His posture suggested waiting rather than coincidental presence, one leg crossed casually over the other, hands resting with calculated nonchalance on the chair's arms.
"I've been calculating how early you might attempt this," Felix said, his voice pitched low but perfectly audible in the pre-dawn stillness. "Four-thirty seemed most probable, allowing for your preference for precision and the current sunrise schedule. I erred slightly on the cautious side."
Emil experienced an unfamiliar sensation—something between scientific admiration for the accurate prediction and professional irritation at having his strategy anticipated. He maintained his position at the threshold, reassessing options given this unexpected variable.
"I have early laboratory preparations requiring attention," Emil stated, selecting an explanation that offered professional necessity rather than avoidance. "The anesthetic compound samples require monitoring at specific intervals."
Felix remained motionless except for a slight tilt of his head, the gesture conveying skepticism without requiring verbal expression. "The laboratory is closed for renovation until noon today. You recommended the schedule yourself last month to accommodate the ventilation system upgrades."
The factual correction registered with unwelcome precision. Emil had indeed suggested the renovation timing, though the detail had been temporarily misplaced in his calculations. An unusual oversight that suggested potential cognitive effects from reduced glucose availability—a variable requiring documentation for experimental consideration.
"Alternative research locations exist within the university complex," Emil replied, adjusting his explanation to accommodate this correction. "The medical library opens at five for faculty research."
"Today is Thursday," Felix said, his voice maintaining its measured calm. "The entire west wing, including the medical library, is closed until noon for the quarterly cleaning. Again, a schedule you yourself helped establish as department head for research methodology."
Emil noted with clinical detachment that his heart rate had increased by approximately twenty percent during this exchange—an unexpected physiological response requiring analysis. The sensation of being anticipated, of having escape routes systematically closed through prior knowledge of his own established patterns, created an unfamiliar cognitive dissonance.
"You've been monitoring my schedule," Emil observed, the statement emerging as professional assessment rather than accusation.
Felix uncrossed his legs and leaned forward slightly, his movements displaying the unconscious grace that Emil had documented since their university days. "I've been paying attention," he corrected gently. "There's a substantial difference."
The gray pre-dawn light had strengthened marginally, illuminating Felix's features with greater clarity. Emil observed signs of fatigue manifesting in his colleague's appearance—slight shadows beneath the eyes, minimal reduction in normal skin tone, a barely perceptible tension in facial musculature. The indicators suggested significant sleep deficit accumulated over multiple days.
"You appear to have been awake throughout the night," Emil stated, applying observational methodology to redirect the interaction's focus.
"A calculated risk," Felix acknowledged, the ghost of a smile touching his features. "Unlike you, I factor adequate recovery time into my physiological equations. My architectural presentation isn't until tomorrow afternoon."
Emil remained at the threshold, calculating remaining options given the current parameters. Direct confrontation appeared inefficient given Felix's apparent preparation and physical positioning. Retreat to the guest room would simply delay the inevitable interaction while suggesting capitulation. Professional engagement represented the most strategic approach.
"The meeting with Weber is not scheduled until three this afternoon," Emil said, advancing into the sitting room with measured steps. "Early preparations remain a legitimate professional priority."
Felix rose from the chair in a single fluid motion, his height and natural physical economy momentarily dominating the space between them. Since their university days, Emil had documented the unconscious grace that characterized Felix's movements—the anatomical efficiency that Emil's own experimental protocols sought to achieve through more deliberate means.
"The preparations Weber requested involve breakfast," Felix said, gesturing toward the apartment's small dining area where, Emil now noticed, the table had been set for two despite the early hour. "A meal taken together before the formal meeting to establish certain baselines for discussion."
The arrangement represented strategic forethought that Emil acknowledged with reluctant professional respect. Felix had anticipated not merely the escape attempt but had prepared appropriate countermeasures with considerable attention to detail.
"A professional meeting does not require preliminary social engagement," Emil countered, maintaining his position despite the illogical urge to retreat from this unexpected scenario.
"This isn't a professional meeting, Emil," Felix replied, his voice carrying an unusual quality that registered as significant despite Emil's difficulty in precise categorization. "It's three people who have known each other for nearly a decade expressing concern about a colleague's health in the least institutionally threatening manner possible."
The direct acknowledgment created a momentary processing delay in Emil's response calculation. The distinction between professional intervention and personal concern represented a variable his preparations had not adequately addressed.
"My health remains within acceptable parameters for current research requirements," Emil stated, the standard response emerging with practiced ease. "Temporary physiological adjustments reflect intellectual priorities rather than medical concern."
Felix stepped forward, reducing the physical distance between them with deliberate purpose. His expression carried a complexity Emil found challenging to interpret—professional concern layered with emotional elements that defied precise categorization.
"When we returned from the countryside," Felix said quietly, "you collapsed while climbing the stairs to the archive. Your heart rate was so erratic that the castle physician initially suspected digitalis poisoning. Your body temperature was three degrees below normal. You remained unconscious for nearly seven hours. These are not 'acceptable parameters' by any medical or scientific standard."
The factual recounting contained specific measurements that Emil had not previously documented—data points from the period of unconsciousness that his experimental records necessarily omitted. The information represented valuable documentation despite its unwelcome source.
"Temporary circulatory adjustment resulting from inadequate atmospheric acclimatization," Emil replied, reclassifying the incident within acceptable experimental parameters. "The altitude difference between Prague and the castle location created unforeseen variables."
Felix closed his eyes briefly, the gesture suggesting a complex emotional response that Emil couldn't immediately decode. When he reopened them, something had shifted in his expression—a resolution that registered as potentially significant.
"The castle sits seventy meters lower in elevation than Prague," Felix said, each word precisely measured. "I checked the geographical surveys myself after we returned. The atmospheric difference would produce the opposite effect to what you described."
The factual correction registered with uncomfortable precision. Emil had indeed miscalculated the elevation differential, an error suggesting cognitive impact more significant than previously documented. He adjusted his internal assessment accordingly while maintaining his external professional composure.
"Alternative environmental factors may have contributed," he amended, pivot ing to a more sustainable explanation. "The countryside air composition differs significantly from urban conditions."
Felix stepped closer still, his height requiring Emil to adjust his gaze upward slightly—a physical dynamic that created an unexpected sensation of vulnerability despite its simple anatomical basis.
"Emil," Felix said, his voice lowered to a register that seemed to bypass normal auditory processing, "you weigh less now than you did at fifteen years old. I know because I still have the sketches from our first university term—the anatomical studies from Professor Havel's class. I compared them with what I see now."
The statement penetrated more precisely than Weber's diagnostic handshake or any of the medical assessments Emil had evaded in recent months. The introduction of documented historical comparison created a variable his carefully constructed explanations couldn't easily accommodate.
"Artistic interpretation naturally contains subjective elements," Emil replied, though he registered the reduced conviction in his own response.
"I measured you," Felix said simply. "You were unconscious, and the physician needed physical parameters for his assessment. Chest circumference, wrist diameter, waist measurement. I recorded them precisely, as you would have. I still have the notebook with your measurements from our university anatomical studies for comparison."
Emil experienced an unfamiliar sensation—something between scientific interest in this unexpected data source and a deeper response he couldn't immediately categorize. The existence of comparative measurements represented both valuable documentation and troubling evidence that could compromise experimental control.
"Weber wishes to review your findings?" Emil asked, changing approach to gather additional information about the afternoon's planned intervention.
Felix shook his head slightly. "Weber has seen enough during your professional interactions to form his preliminary conclusions. Today's meeting is an opportunity for you to provide context before more formal institutional processes become necessary."
The implications registered clearly. Weber's position within the medical faculty carried significant authority; his concerns could trigger mandatory medical leave or formal fitness-for-duty evaluation. The strategic importance of attending the afternoon meeting had increased substantially given this information.
"I see," Emil said, processing these implications with scientific detachment. "And your role in this evaluation?"
Something shifted in Felix's expression—a complexity Emil couldn't fully decode despite years of documented observation. "I'm not evaluating you, Emil. I'm trying to help you see what's happening before it's too late."
The statement contained multiple elements requiring analysis: the distinction between evaluation and intervention; the implication of progressive deterioration; the suggestion of a critical threshold approaching. Emil categorized these elements while maintaining his outward professional composure.
"The early hour limits productive discussion of these matters," Emil said, adjusting his approach to acknowledge the inescapability of the afternoon meeting while preserving immediate autonomy. "Perhaps we might resume this conversation after I've completed my morning research requirements."
Felix studied him for several seconds, his gaze carrying an intensity Emil found difficult to withstand despite his clinical detachment. "You'll attend the meeting at three?"
"Professional courtesy requires appropriate response to collegial concern," Emil replied, selecting phrasing that acknowledged the obligation without specific commitment.
Felix's expression suggested he recognized the linguistic precision of this non-answer, but he nodded slightly. "The coffee is freshly made. There's bread and preserves on the table. I'll be in my study organizing the presentation materials for tomorrow."
The retreat represented temporary resolution rather than capitulation. Emil recognized the strategic nature of Felix's withdrawal—providing space while maintaining monitoring proximity. The approach displayed both psychological insight and tactical forethought that Emil acknowledged with reluctant professional respect.
As Felix moved toward his study, Emil remained motionless, recalculating options given these new parameters. The morning light had strengthened, illuminating the small dining table with its carefully arranged breakfast setting—two plates, bread, butter, preserves, coffee pot gently steaming.
Emil approached the table with measured steps, assessing the laid-out food with clinical precision. The bread appeared freshly baked, its crust maintaining optimal structural integrity. The coffee emitted approximately 97% of standard olfactory stimulation, suggesting proper brewing technique despite the unusual hour.
He seated himself with careful movements, calculating the caloric content of the displayed items against the energy requirements of the day ahead—particularly the three o'clock meeting, which would demand significant cognitive resources for strategic navigation. The mental ledger balanced precariously, suggesting minimal intake might prove necessary despite preferred experimental protocols.
Emil poured coffee into the waiting cup, the familiar aroma triggering involuntary physiological responses—increased salivation, mild digestive anticipation, memory association with previous consumption experiences. He assessed these reactions with scientific detachment while adding precisely three drops of milk—sufficient to reduce acidity without significant caloric impact.
From the study doorway, Felix observed this process with an expression Emil couldn't fully interpret despite years of documented interaction. The watching figure represented both immediate concern and potential interference, yet also carried the unexpected data points that might prove valuable to experimental documentation. A complex variable requiring careful integration into modified protocols.
Emil raised the coffee cup in a gesture that acknowledged this observation without surrendering experimental control. Felix nodded slightly in response, the ghost of a smile touching his features before he withdrew into the study, leaving Emil to calculate the precise balance of cooperation and resistance that would carry him through the increasingly complicated hours ahead.
Outside, Prague emerged from pre-dawn darkness into early morning light, the city's rhythms accelerating toward day while inside the apartment, two colleagues maintained their positions in a delicate equilibrium of concern, resistance, observation, and calculation that had characterized their relationship since university days. The three o'clock meeting with Weber loomed in Emil's awareness, a fixed point requiring strategic preparation despite the unexpected complications of this early morning confrontation.
Emil documented these observations with his usual precision, categorizing them alongside other data points in the continuously updated ledger of transformation that occupied his scientific awareness with unwavering certainty—even as that certainty encountered increasing resistance from the evidence Felix had so carefully collected.


Five-forty-six in the morning. Emil and Felix stood in the sitting room of Felix's apartment, the early light casting long shadows across the scattered evidence they'd been examining. Emil observed Felix's expression with scientific interest—the complex emotions manifesting in minute facial adjustments that most observers would miss but which Emil had documented with precision throughout their acquaintance.
"Disturbing Weber's office would create unnecessary risk," Emil stated, organizing the documents with methodical care. "The meeting itself provides optimal opportunity for assessment with minimal exposure."
Felix looked up, surprise evident in his posture—the slight straightening of his spine, the minimal elevation of his eyebrows. "You still intend to attend the meeting? After what we've discussed?"
"With modification to the original parameters," Emil clarified, noting Felix's concern with clinical detachment. "Your presence ensures an unavoidable witness. Weber would not attempt acquisition with you present regardless of intent."
Something shifted in Felix's expression—a complexity Emil couldn't fully decode despite years of documented observation. "You trust me to that degree?"
The question contained elements beyond its surface inquiry. Emil calculated his response with unusual care, aware of implications beyond the immediate strategic consideration.
"Your presence represents both tactical advantage and personal consideration," Emil replied, selecting his words with precision. "The combination provides optimal security."
Felix's gaze held Emil's for several seconds longer than their typical eye contact duration—an extension Emil noted with scientific interest. The moment carried significance beyond its temporal measurement, though Emil found himself unable to categorize the specific quality with his usual precision.
"There's something else we should consider," Emil continued, retrieving his leather portfolio from the desk. He removed a folded paper from an inner pocket, carefully preserved in its original condition. "This was left at my bedside approximately seventeen days ago. I was going to bring it to your attention after resolving more pressing matters."
Felix accepted the paper with careful hands. As he unfolded it, his expression shifted through multiple configurations—surprise, alarm, and an intensity Emil hadn't previously documented in their interactions.
The note contained a single line of text in elegant, precise handwriting: "Your breathing pattern changes at precisely 2:17 AM when you enter deep sleep. The slight parting of your lips is most pronounced when you lie on your left side."
"This was by your bed?" Felix asked, his voice carrying an unusual quality. "While you slept?"
Emil nodded with clinical precision. "Left sometime between 1:30 AM when I retired and 5:45 AM when I awakened. My door remained locked from the inside with the key in place. The window similarly secured."
Felix studied the handwriting with focused attention. "This isn't Weber's handwriting. His script is more angular, with distinctive connecting strokes between certain letters."
"I noted the discrepancy," Emil acknowledged. "However, your hypothesis regarding Weber as the Protégé remains viable if he employs an amanuensis or secretary for certain communications."
Felix continued examining the note, his architect's attention to detail evident in his methodical assessment. "Or Weber isn't the Protégé at all, and we're looking in the wrong direction entirely."
The observation displayed logical rigor despite the emotional context of their investigation. Emil acknowledged its validity with scientific appreciation. "Multiple hypotheses should remain under consideration pending conclusive evidence."
Felix returned the note with careful movements. Their fingers brushed momentarily during the exchange—incidental contact that nevertheless registered with unexpected clarity in Emil's awareness. He catalogued this response for later analysis, focusing instead on the immediate strategic considerations.
"How do you suggest we approach the meeting?" Felix asked, his natural grace reasserting itself as the conversation shifted to practical planning.
"With scientific observation as our primary methodology," Emil replied. "Weber's behavior, language choices, and physical positioning will provide valuable data regardless of his true intent. You maintain your original concern regarding my health, while I present as receptive but non-committal to intervention."
Felix's expression suggested internal conflict—an unusual complexity Emil found difficult to interpret despite his extensive observations of Felix's typical emotional patterns.
"You're asking me to continue expressing concern I genuinely feel," Felix said carefully, "while attempting not to reveal I've completely changed my interpretation of Weber's intentions."
"The most effective deception maintains maximum alignment with authentic presentation," Emil noted, applying experimental methodology to their strategic approach. "Your genuine concern provides optimal cover for observation."
Felix moved toward the window, his tall frame silhouetted against the strengthening morning light. The unconscious elegance of his movement registered in Emil's awareness with scientific appreciation—the natural economy Felix displayed without deliberate effort, the structural efficiency Emil's own experimental protocols sought to achieve through more calculated means.
"It feels dishonest," Felix said finally, his voice carrying an unfamiliar quality. "To use my real concern as cover for suspicion."
Emil considered this ethical dilemma with scientific detachment, though he noted an unusual reluctance to dismiss Felix's moral hesitation. "The approach prioritizes safety while maintaining observation integrity. If Weber's intentions prove benign, no harm results from our caution."
Felix turned from the window, the light behind him creating a momentary halo effect that Emil documented with clinical precision while noting the aesthetic impact—an irrelevant observation he nonetheless filed alongside the strategic considerations.
"And if Weber truly is concerned about you?" Felix asked, the question carrying weight beyond its surface inquiry. "If this meeting is genuinely an attempt to help?"
Emil calculated his response with unusual care, aware of implications beyond immediate strategic planning. "Then we will have exercised appropriate caution while potentially receiving valuable medical consultation. The approach optimizes outcomes regardless of Weber's true intent."
Felix studied Emil with an intensity that registered as significant despite Emil's difficulty in precise categorization. "You've calculated all possible variables except one."
Emil tilted his head slightly, the gesture acknowledging the statement's cryptic nature while requesting clarification.
"Whether I can bear to watch you continue slipping away," Felix said, his voice lowered to a register that seemed to bypass normal auditory processing, "regardless of whether the threat is Weber or yourself."
The statement penetrated more deeply than Emil anticipated. He found himself processing its implications with uncharacteristic difficulty, the scientific detachment momentarily disrupted by the personal relevance of this analysis.
"Current circumstances suggest immediate safety considerations take precedence over long-term physiological debate," Emil replied, though he recognized the reduced conviction in his own assessment.
Felix moved closer, reducing the physical distance between them with deliberate purpose. "We'll attend the meeting at three. We'll observe Weber with scientific precision. We'll protect you from external threat if one exists."
He paused, the moment extending beyond typical conversational parameters. "But afterward, Emil, we will have a different conversation—one about internal threat rather than external. One about why you're documenting your own disappearance with such clinical detachment."
The proximity between them created an unusual awareness in Emil's perception—the slight elevation of his pulse, the minimal increase in respiratory rate, the subtle shift in peripheral focus that centered Felix in his visual field. He catalogued these responses with scientific precision while acknowledging their atypical nature in professional interaction.
"Sequential problem resolution represents optimal methodology," Emil stated, though he found himself unusually aware of the inadequacy of this response against the complexity of Felix's concern.
Felix's expression shifted to something Emil hadn't previously documented in their interactions—a complex combination of determination, concern, and another quality that defied immediate categorization but which registered as significant nonetheless.
"Three o'clock, then," Felix said quietly. "But this isn't finished, Emil. Not by experimental methodology or scientific conclusion."
The statement carried implications beyond its literal meaning—layers Emil found himself processing with unusual attention to emotional rather than purely logical content. The experience created a curious cognitive dissonance he filed for later analysis when immediate safety concerns had been addressed.
As the morning light strengthened, Emil calculated the hours remaining before their confrontation with Weber—time that would require careful preparation, strategic planning, and energy conservation. Yet beneath these practical considerations, Felix's words continued to register with unexpected persistence: "This isn't finished, Emil."
The statement contained a promise rather than a threat, though Emil found himself uncertain why this distinction registered as significant. He documented this observation alongside others from their exchange, clinical detachment maintained despite the unusual awareness of Felix's proximity, concern, and the complex emotion in his expression that Emil still couldn't precisely categorize but which created an unfamiliar response in his own cognitive processes.

At precisely three o'clock, Emil and Felix stood outside the western conference room door. The faculty corridor stretched empty in both directions, confirming Felix's observation about the Thursday afternoon schedule creating unusual isolation in this wing of the building.
"Remember," Felix said quietly, his voice pitched for privacy despite their solitude, "I maintain my concern about your health while observing Weber's behavior. You present as receptive but non-committal."
Emil nodded with careful precision, conserving energy while acknowledging the strategic approach. The twenty-minute walk from Felix's apartment to the university had required careful calculation of exertion against available reserves—a balance maintained through methodical pace and optimal route selection.
"Weber's response to your unexpected presence will provide initial behavioral data," Emil noted, clinical assessment providing familiar structure despite the unusual circumstances.
Felix's hand moved briefly toward Emil's arm before stopping short of contact—a gesture Emil categorized as aborted reassurance, notable for both its initiation and its restraint. The moment created an awareness that registered in Emil's perception with unexpected clarity.
"If at any point you feel unsafe," Felix said, his voice carrying that quality Emil still couldn't precisely name, "we leave immediately, regardless of social propriety or professional courtesy."
Emil calculated the improbability of physical threat in a university setting against the unusual circumstances of their meeting. "Agreed, though risk assessment suggests minimal danger with your presence as deterrent."
Felix held Emil's gaze for several seconds longer than their typical eye contact duration—another extension Emil noted with scientific interest. Then he nodded once and opened the conference room door.
Weber stood at the far window, his back momentarily to the door as he adjusted the blinds to moderate the afternoon light. He turned at their entrance, his expression shifting through multiple configurations before settling into careful professional neutrality.
"Ah, Dr. Králik," Weber said, his gaze moving from Emil to Felix with brief but evident recalculation. "And Herr von Rothenberg. I wasn't expecting additional participants in our discussion."
Emil registered the momentary disruption to Weber's composure—the slight elevation in vocal pitch, the minimal hesitation before acknowledging Felix, the subtle adjustment in physical positioning that suggested strategic reassessment. Weber's reaction to Felix's presence provided valuable behavioral data, though its interpretation remained ambiguous.
"I asked Felix to join us," Emil replied, selecting an explanation that offered professional courtesy while asserting his agency in the arrangement. "His observations over recent weeks may prove valuable to our discussion."
Weber nodded, professional composure fully restored. "Of course. Please, be seated. I've arranged for tea to be delivered shortly."
Emil noted the seating arrangement with clinical precision—three chairs positioned around a small table rather than the larger conference table dominating the room's center. The configuration suggested conversation rather than examination, though Emil observed that Weber's selected chair provided optimal observational position with clear sightlines to both visitors.
Felix moved with deliberate casualness, selecting the chair that placed him between Emil and the room's secondary door—a positioning Emil recognized as strategic rather than coincidental. The arrangement established Felix as both buffer and observer, maintaining the protective function while enabling comprehensive assessment of Weber's behavior.
"I appreciate you taking time from your research schedule," Weber began, his tone modulated to convey professional concern without excessive emotional display. "Particularly given the significant demands of your current projects."
Emil calculated his response with scientific detachment, balancing receptiveness against strategic caution. "Professional courtesy naturally accommodates collegial consultation."
Weber's gaze held Emil's with the focused attention Emil had documented in previous medical assessments. "I'll speak directly, as our academic relationship has always favored clarity over diplomacy. Your physical condition has deteriorated to a point requiring immediate medical intervention."
The statement's directness aligned with Weber's established communication patterns rather than suggesting unusual intent. Emil noted this consistency with scientific interest while maintaining his external professional composure.
"Research intensity naturally creates periodic fluctuations in personal habits," Emil replied, employing the explanation he had developed for such inquiries. "Temporary physiological adjustments reflect intellectual priorities rather than medical concern."
"Emil," Weber responded, using the familiar address that indicated shift from professional to personal concern, "your weight has decreased by approximately twenty-five percent in the past eight months. Your resting pulse fluctuates between fifty and fifty-five beats per minute. Your extremities show persistent cyanosis even in warm environments. Your hand tremors have progressed from occasional to regular. These are not 'fluctuations' but progressive deterioration."
The assessment displayed medical precision without exaggeration—each observation factually accurate based on Emil's own documented measurements. The diagnostic accuracy suggested legitimate medical concern rather than predatory interest, though Emil maintained strategic caution pending further behavioral evidence.
"Eduard," Felix interjected, his voice carrying the genuine concern that required no fabrication, "Emil's condition indeed warrants attention, but perhaps a less clinical approach might prove more productive. His research commitments require careful consideration in any intervention strategy."
Emil observed the interaction with scientific detachment, noting Weber's response to Felix's contribution—the slight narrowing of eyes suggesting reassessment, the minimal adjustment in posture indicating recalculation of approach. Weber's reaction appeared consistent with professional adaptation rather than disrupted acquisition planning.
"A fair observation," Weber acknowledged, his gaze returning to Emil with the focused attention of a physician rather than a collector. "Which is why I've prepared several options rather than a single prescription. The university would support a reduced teaching schedule while maintaining your research position. Medical leave remains available without institutional penalty. Outpatient treatment could accommodate your laboratory commitments while addressing the most immediate physical concerns."
The range of options suggested legitimate medical intervention rather than acquisition strategy. Emil categorized this evidence alongside Weber's consistent professional demeanor and factually accurate assessment, the pattern increasingly indicating genuine concern rather than predatory intent.
"Your recommendations appear reasonably structured," Emil noted, maintaining clinical distance while acknowledging the logical framework of Weber's approach. "Though experimental timelines would require significant adjustment under any modified schedule."
The tea arrived, temporarily interrupting their conversation. Emil observed Weber's movements with scientific precision as he arranged the cups and saucers—the efficiency suggesting medical training rather than collector's care, the professional distance maintained rather than the proprietary assessment Felix had hypothesized might be evident in the Protégé's behavior.
As Weber handed Emil his tea, their fingers briefly touched—incidental contact that nevertheless provided additional assessment opportunity. Emil noted Weber's professional restraint, the contact neither prolonged for diagnostic purpose nor avoided with suspicious care. The interaction suggested normal social behavior rather than disguised examination.
"I've known you since your doctoral studies, Emil," Weber said after the tea service had been completed, his voice carrying a quality Emil hadn't previously documented in their interactions—a complexity suggesting resignation rather than clinical assessment. "Your intellectual brilliance has never been in question. Your methodological precision remains unmatched in the department. Which makes your current situation all the more concerning—you're applying your scientific mind to your own destruction with remarkable efficiency."
The observation penetrated more deeply than Emil anticipated. He found himself processing its implications with uncharacteristic difficulty, the scientific detachment momentarily disrupted by the personal relevance of this analysis. Weber's assessment aligned with Emil's own experimental documentation while reaching a fundamentally different conclusion regarding purpose and outcome.
Felix shifted slightly in his chair, the movement registering in Emil's peripheral awareness with unexpected clarity. The proximity between them created an unusual consciousness in Emil's perception—the subtle indication of support without overt intervention, the unspoken communication of presence rather than protection.
"Eduard," Emil replied, selecting his words with careful precision, "your concern reflects professional responsibility and personal history that I acknowledge with appropriate appreciation. The current circumstances, however, involve complex factors beyond immediate medical parameters."
Weber studied Emil for several long seconds, his expression shifting through multiple configurations before settling into something Emil found difficult to categorize—not the clinical assessment he had documented in previous interactions, but a deeper resignation that registered as significant despite its emotional rather than scientific basis.
"You are slipping away, Emil," Weber said finally, his voice carrying that unfamiliar quality of resignation rather than clinical observation. "Regardless of diagnosis, etiology, cause, the prognosis remains the same."
He glanced briefly at Felix before returning his attention to Emil, the moment suggesting calculation rather than suspicion. "You may have your friend Herr von Rothenberg fooled, but I am merely resigned. Not to losing you as a colleague—though that would be significant loss to the department—but to watching you disappear while documenting the process with scientific precision."
The statement registered with unexpected impact. Emil found himself calculating a response with unusual difficulty, the familiar scientific framework temporarily inadequate against the emotional complexity of Weber's assessment.
"My current research requires unusual dedication," Emil replied, the explanation emerging with less certainty than his typical responses. "Temporary physical adjustments reflect experimental priorities rather than concerning patterns."
"Emil," Weber said quietly, something in his tone causing Emil to meet his gaze with unusual directness, "I've treated five patients with your condition during my career. Two survived. None recovered fully. All insisted their patterns were temporary, controlled, and scientifically justified until they could no longer stand without assistance."
The medical assessment presented with disturbing precision. Emil found himself categorizing Weber's statement alongside his own experimental documentation, the parallel creating an uncomfortable cognitive dissonance that would require significant processing once immediate concerns had been addressed.
"Your professional experience naturally informs your assessment," Emil acknowledged, maintaining clinical distance while recognizing the factual framework of Weber's concern. "Though individual cases present with variable progression and outcome potential."
Weber's expression suggested he recognized the defensive nature of this response, though his reaction indicated resignation rather than frustration. "My office door remains open, Emil, whenever you decide professional intervention might complement personal methodology."
He rose with the careful movements of a man accustomed to patient examination, his posture suggesting conclusion rather than continued pressure. "I've documented my concerns for institutional purposes, but any intervention remains at your discretion. The university values your contributions sufficiently to accommodate significant flexibility in addressing these issues."
Emil calculated the implications of this approach—the documented concern fulfilling professional obligation while avoiding forced intervention, the continued access to university facilities despite physical deterioration, the maintained professional respect despite medical concern. The pattern suggested legitimate medical consideration rather than acquisition strategy.
Felix stood with unconscious grace, his natural physical economy momentarily drawing Weber's professional attention before the older physician returned his focus to Emil.
"Thank you for your time, Eduard," Felix said, his voice carrying the genuine concern that had required no fabrication throughout their meeting. "Your perspective provides valuable consideration for our ongoing discussions."
Weber nodded, his gaze returning to Emil with that quality of resignation rather than clinical assessment. "The medical faculty has resources available regardless of when you choose to access them. Day or night, my door remains open."
As they moved toward the main exit, Emil noted that Weber made no attempt to direct them toward the secondary door Felix had identified as potential acquisition route. The behavioral evidence, combined with Weber's consistent professional demeanor and legitimate medical assessment, suggested Felix's hypothesis regarding Weber as the Protégé had been misguided despite its logical construction.
Outside in the faculty corridor, Emil calculated the implications of their meeting against the evidence they had gathered. The pattern increasingly indicated Weber's genuine medical concern rather than predatory interest, though the note at Emil's bedside remained unexplained within this interpretation.
"Weber is not the Protégé," Emil stated once they had reached sufficient distance for private conversation, the conclusion emerging with scientific certainty despite its disruption to their investigative hypothesis.
Felix nodded, his expression suggesting both relief regarding Weber and renewed concern regarding the actual Protégé's identity. "His concern appears genuine, if resigned. But that leaves us with an unknown threat still observing you—still leaving notes by your bedside while you sleep."
The assessment aligned with Emil's own conclusion, the logical structure requiring immediate strategic reconsideration. "The evidence suggests Weber's intervention and the Protégé's interest represent separate concerns rather than coordinated threat."
"Which means," Felix said carefully, his voice lowered despite the empty corridor, "that we've been looking in the wrong direction while the actual Protégé continues their observation unimpeded."
Emil calculated the implications with scientific detachment, though he noted an unusual awareness of Felix's proximity as they walked—the unconscious synchronization of their steps, the maintained distance that nonetheless suggested connection rather than separation.
"The hypothesis requires complete reconstruction based on available evidence," Emil acknowledged, clinical assessment providing familiar structure despite the disruptive implications for their investigation.
Felix's pace faltered slightly, the disruption to his natural grace registering in Emil's awareness with unexpected clarity. "Emil," he said, his voice carrying that quality Emil still couldn't precisely name but which created an unfamiliar response in his own cognitive processes, "there's something I need to say before we continue this investigation."
Emil adjusted his pace to match Felix's modified movement, the synchronization occurring without conscious calculation. "Additional hypotheses naturally emerge from evidence reassessment."
"Not a hypothesis," Felix corrected gently, stopping entirely and turning to face Emil with unusual directness. "A truth I've been avoiding while focusing on external threats rather than internal patterns."
The distinction registered with unexpected significance. Emil found himself calculating his response with unusual care, aware of implications beyond the immediate investigative reconsideration.
"Truth naturally emerges through evidence examination," Emil noted, though he recognized the inadequacy of this response against the intensity in Felix's expression.
"The truth," Felix said quietly, his voice carrying that quality that seemed to bypass normal auditory processing, "is that I cannot bear to watch you disappear, whether through Weber's prognosticated illness or the Protégé's collection. Not because of professional concern or scientific interest, but because of what you are to me beyond colleague or research subject."
The statement penetrated more deeply than Weber's medical assessment or the Protégé's bedside note. Emil found himself processing its implications with uncharacteristic difficulty, the scientific detachment momentarily inadequate against the emotional complexity of Felix's declaration.
"Statistical probability suggests enhanced survival potential through collaborative approach," Emil replied, the clinical phrasing emerging despite his awareness of its inadequacy against the personal significance of Felix's statement.
Felix's expression shifted to something Emil hadn't previously documented in their interactions—a complex combination of exasperation, affection, and that persistent quality that continued to defy immediate categorization but which registered as increasingly significant in Emil's awareness.
"That," Felix said with unexpected gentleness, "is the most emotionally stunted acceptance of caring I've ever received. But from you, Emil, I recognize it as profound acknowledgment."
The assessment displayed surprising accuracy despite its emotional rather than scientific basis. Emil found himself nodding with careful precision, accepting both the observation and its implications with unusual openness despite the unfamiliar cognitive territory this exchange represented.
As they resumed their walk through the university corridors, Emil calculated the dual challenges they now faced: identifying the actual Protégé who continued to observe him with collection intent, and addressing the deterioration Weber had documented with medical precision.
The complexity of these parallel concerns created an unusual awareness in Emil's perception—the scientific detachment momentarily balanced against personal consideration rather than maintained in isolation. Felix's presence beside him registered not merely as strategic advantage but as significant value independent of investigative function.
Emil documented these observations with his usual precision, categorizing them alongside other data points from their exchange. Yet beneath the clinical assessment, Felix's words continued to register with unexpected persistence: "what you are to me beyond colleague or research subject."
The statement contained implications Emil found himself processing with unusual attention to emotional rather than purely logical content—a significant deviation from experimental protocol that would require extensive analysis once immediate security concerns had been addressed.
For now, however, the immediate priority remained clear: reconstructing their investigative approach to identify the actual Protégé while protecting against both external threat and internal deterioration—a dual challenge requiring both scientific methodology and the unfamiliar territory of collaborative care Felix had so unexpectedly introduced into Emil's carefully controlled experimental parameters.


Six-forty-eight in the evening. The walk from the university back to Felix's apartment had proceeded in unusual silence, each man apparently absorbed in private calculation following their meeting with Weber. Emil had maintained precise distance between them, automatically matching Felix's pace while documenting the physical requirements of the journey against his diminishing reserves.
Felix's door closed behind them with definitive weight, sealing them into the private space they had shared since Emil's collapse at the castle. The apartment held an unfamiliar quality in evening light—shadows gathering in corners, lamp glow creating islands of illumination, the sense of enclosure both comforting and constricting in Emil's perception.
"You should eat something," Felix said, breaking the extended silence with careful neutrality. "I could prepare a simple soup, perhaps, or eggs if you prefer. Something light but substantive."
Emil felt an immediate internal resistance solidify like cooling metal. The suggestion, regardless of its reasonable presentation, threatened the carefully constructed framework of his experimental protocol. More significantly, it represented external interference in the one domain where he maintained complete control.
"My evening routine includes a scheduled walk of approximately seventy-three minutes," Emil replied, his voice assuming the clinical detachment that had proven his most effective defense. "Nutritional intake follows specific activity completion to optimize metabolic efficiency."
Felix turned from where he had been removing his coat, his expression carrying a complex quality that registered as concern without clinical detachment—personal rather than professional, genuine rather than obligatory. The distinction created an uncomfortable awareness in Emil's perception.
"Emil," Felix said quietly, "you're not going walking tonight. Not after everything we've learned today. Not with the Protégé still unidentified and possibly watching your movements."
The direct contradiction to his established protocol registered as more than simple disagreement. It represented a fundamental challenge to the autonomy Emil had preserved through scientific methodology—the control he maintained through precise calculation when all other aspects of existence proved increasingly uncertain.
"Physical activity represents essential experimental component," Emil stated, his voice hardening with unusual defensiveness. "Caloric expenditure requires precise measurement for accurate documentation."
Something shifted in Felix's expression—a hardening that suggested determination rather than simple concern. "No more documentation. No more experimentation. No more scientific distance from what you're doing to yourself."
The directness struck with physical force. Emil felt his internal defenses crystallize, the familiar protective shell of scientific detachment thickening against this unprecedented threat to his carefully constructed system. The emotional reaction surprised him with its intensity—not simply resistance but something approaching panic at the prospect of protocol disruption.
"The methodology requires consistent application," Emil insisted, hearing the unusual edge in his voice that betrayed emotional rather than objective motivation. "Experimental integrity depends on protocol adherence regardless of external variables."
"Then show me," Felix said suddenly, his voice carrying an unexpected intensity. "If this is truly scientific methodology rather than self-destruction, then demonstrate it without concealment. Allow me to observe the complete protocol you've been documenting with such clinical precision."
The challenge created immediate internal alarm. The prospect of Felix witnessing not merely individual components but the entire integrated system of his transformation methodology threatened the private nature of his experimental process—the controlled isolation that protected both his scientific pursuit and the deeper psychological satisfaction it provided.
"Observational interference naturally disrupts experimental conditions," Emil replied, selecting scientific objection to mask the profound vulnerability Felix's proposal created. "External monitoring introduces unnecessary variables."
"No more evasion, Emil," Felix said, moving closer with deliberate purpose. "You've been conducting this 'experiment' for months while hiding its true nature from everyone around you. If it's legitimate scientific methodology as you claim, then you should have no objection to transparent observation."
The logic presented with uncomfortable precision. Emil found himself cornered not by external force but by logical consequence—each potential objection simply confirming the concerns Felix had expressed. The cognitive trap created an unusual emotional response—a sensation of exposure that threatened the protective isolation his experimental framework had carefully maintained.
"The evening routine includes specific measurement procedures," Emil acknowledged, reluctantly accepting limited transparency as strategically unavoidable. "Documentation requires precise protocols that may appear unnecessarily detailed to non-scientific observation."
"I'm an architect, Emil," Felix reminded him with unexpected gentleness. "I understand systematic measurement and detailed documentation. What I don't understand is why you're applying these methodologies to your own disappearance while calling it science."
The gentleness penetrated more effectively than confrontation could have. Emil felt a momentary wavering in his defensive structure—not from the logical argument but from the genuine concern evident in Felix's expression. The realization created immediate internal correction, a tightening of scientific detachment to counteract this emotional vulnerability.
"The transformation protocol follows established scientific methodology," Emil insisted, his voice assuming the clinical precision that had proven his most effective barrier against emotional intrusion. "Physical refinement requires systematic approach rather than arbitrary modification."
Felix remained silent for several seconds, his expression suggesting internal calculation rather than simple reaction. Then, with deliberate movements, he began removing his waistcoat and rolling up his shirtsleeves.
"If we're going walking," he said quietly, "then we go together. If you're measuring, I observe. If you're documenting, I read. No more separation between what you call science and what Weber calls illness."
The comprehensive nature of this approach threatened total disruption to Emil's carefully constructed isolation. More significantly, Felix's gentle persistence suggested a depth of personal investment that created uncomfortable awareness in Emil's perception—the possibility that he was misinterpreting professional concern or collegial friendship as something more profound, projecting his own deviant inclinations onto Felix's natural kindness.
The thought crystallized with disturbing clarity: Emil's scientific mind registered the growing possibility that he was corrupting Felix's genuine friendship with inappropriate significance, interpreting normal concern through the distorted lens of his own unnatural attractions. The realization created immediate shame that transformed into reinforced commitment to his experimental protocols—the structured discipline providing not merely scientific purpose but psychological protection against such deviant impulses.
"Your presence introduces variables beyond experimental parameters," Emil stated, his voice assuming the clinical detachment that protected both his methodology and Felix from the contamination of his inappropriate interpretations. "The protocol functions optimally under controlled isolation."
"My presence," Felix corrected gently, "ensures you return safely while the Protégé remains unidentified. It also prevents you from deceiving either of us about what you're actually doing under the guise of scientific methodology."
The dual purpose presented with unexpected precision. Emil found himself calculating the security benefit regarding the Protégé against the protective disruption of his experimental isolation. The tension created unusual cognitive dissonance—the logical acceptance of Felix's security argument against the emotional resistance to his observational intent.
"The walking route requires seventy-three minutes at optimal pace," Emil finally stated, accepting the inevitability of Felix's participation while internally reinforcing his experimental commitment. "Cardiovascular efficiency necessitates specific exertion parameters."
"Then we maintain your optimal pace," Felix agreed with immediate adaptability. "And afterward, you consume actual nourishment rather than the minimal intake you've been documenting as adequate."
The nutritional stipulation triggered immediate internal fortification. The thought of consuming food beyond his precisely calculated allowance created not merely scientific resistance but visceral aversion—a profound emotional reaction that confirmed the protocol's psychological rather than purely experimental significance.
"Caloric balance requires precise management to maintain optimal transformation progression," Emil stated, his voice assuming the cold precision that protected his essential control. "Excess consumption disrupts established patterns."
"There is no 'excess' possible in your current condition," Felix replied, his voice carrying that quality of genuine concern that created uncomfortable awareness in Emil's perception. "There is only survival or continued deterioration, regardless of what scientific terminology you apply to the process."
The assessment aligned with Weber's medical evaluation while carrying additional emotional weight that threatened the isolated integrity of Emil's experimental framework. The parallel conclusions from medical authority and personal concern created a cognitive dissonance Emil resolved through immediate reinforcement of his scientific detachment—the clinical methodology providing essential protection against both external interference and internal vulnerability.
As they prepared for the evening walk, Emil calculated the strategic requirements of maintaining protocol integrity despite unprecedented observation. Felix's presence necessitated external performance of experimental procedure while preventing the deeper satisfaction the process typically provided—the private sense of control and achievement that constituted the protocol's essential psychological function.
More significantly, Felix's genuine concern created uncomfortable awareness of Emil's potential misinterpretation—the possibility that he was projecting deviant significance onto normal friendship, corrupting Felix's natural kindness with his own unnatural inclinations. The thought reinforced his commitment to the transformation protocol—the structured discipline providing essential protection against such inappropriate emotional contamination.
They stepped into the evening air, Prague's architecture silhouetted against the darkening sky. Emil automatically calculated their route with scientific precision—distance, elevation changes, energy expenditure—while maintaining careful distance from Felix despite his matching pace.
"Your scientific documentation," Felix said as they established their walking rhythm, "when did it transition from medical observation to transformation protocol?"
The question penetrated more precisely than Emil anticipated. He found himself recalling the evolutionary progression of his methodology with unusual attention to its psychological rather than purely procedural development—the gradual shift from documentation to control, from observation to purpose.
"The initial documentation focused on standard medical parameters," Emil acknowledged, selecting minimal disclosure to maintain protective distance. "Cardiovascular markers, nutritional intake, sleep patterns—conventional medical monitoring."
"And when did it become about disappearing?" Felix asked, the directness of his inquiry carrying no judgment but simple clarity that proved difficult to evade.
The question struck with uncomfortable accuracy. Emil felt his internal defenses tighten, scientific detachment providing essential protection against the emotional vulnerability Felix's perceptiveness created. The transition had occurred without explicit acknowledgment—medical documentation gradually evolving into transformation methodology through incremental adjustments that accumulated into profound purpose.
"The parameters shifted toward structural efficiency approximately seven months ago," Emil replied, clinical terminology providing familiar framework against the personal exposure Felix's inquiry created. "Optimal functionality requires precision in both documentation and implementation."
Felix maintained silence for several moments, their footsteps creating synchronized rhythm against the cobblestones. When he spoke again, his voice carried that quality of genuine concern that created uncomfortable awareness in Emil's perception.
"What are you trying to become, Emil?"
The question struck with disturbing precision. Emil felt his internal defenses solidify, scientific detachment providing essential protection against the profound vulnerability this inquiry created. The endpoint of his transformation remained deliberately undefined in his documentation—the process itself providing satisfaction that required no explicit destination, the control itself constituting sufficient purpose.
"Structural refinement represents ongoing process rather than fixed destination," Emil finally replied, the explanation emerging with careful clinical precision. "Optimal efficiency manifests through progressive adjustment rather than predetermined configuration."
"That's methodology, not purpose," Felix observed with unexpected perceptiveness. "You've documented how with remarkable precision while avoiding why entirely."
The assessment displayed unsettling accuracy. Emil felt his internal resistance strengthen, scientific detachment providing essential protection against the psychological exposure Felix's insight threatened. The purpose remained deliberately unexamined within his own documentation—the process itself providing satisfaction that required no explicit justification, the control constituting its own sufficient reason.
They continued walking in silence, Prague's evening landscape unfolding around them. Emil maintained precise pace while calculating the energy expenditure of each segment against his established baseline—the familiar metrics providing comforting structure despite Felix's disruptive presence.
"Your concern reflects personal consideration rather than scientific assessment," Emil noted after several minutes of calculated silence. "The emotional component introduces subjective variables that complicate objective analysis."
Felix glanced at him with an expression Emil couldn't immediately interpret—something between affection and exasperation that created uncomfortable awareness in his perception.
"Yes, Emil," Felix acknowledged with unexpected directness, "my concern is personal rather than scientific. That's precisely what makes it valuable rather than compromising."
The distinction created unusual difficulty in Emil's analytical framework. His experimental methodology had deliberately excluded emotional variables as subjective contamination, yet Felix presented this personal component as essential rather than detrimental to proper assessment. The contradiction threatened the scientific isolation that protected both his protocol integrity and Felix from his potentially deviant misinterpretations.
"Emotional involvement naturally distorts objective observation," Emil stated, his voice assuming the clinical detachment that provided essential protection against vulnerability. "Scientific methodology requires detachment for accurate documentation."
"And that detachment," Felix replied with gentle precision, "is exactly what allows you to document your own disappearance without intervention. You've removed yourself as subject while maintaining yourself as observer—a dissociation that any psychologist would recognize as profoundly disturbing."
The assessment penetrated with unexpected clarity. Emil felt his internal defenses strengthen further, scientific detachment providing essential protection against the psychological exposure Felix's insight threatened. The separation between observer and subject constituted a fundamental component of his experimental approach—the dissociation allowing both scientific progression and psychological satisfaction his integrated awareness would necessarily have questioned.
As they continued their precisely calculated route, Emil became increasingly conscious of Felix's proximity—not the clinical assessment Weber had employed or the predatory observation the Protégé represented, but something more complex that created uncomfortable awareness in his perception.
The realization emerged with disturbing clarity: Emil found himself interpreting Felix's concern through inappropriate parameters that extended beyond professional or collegial boundaries. The recognition created immediate internal correction—a tightening of scientific detachment to counteract this deviant misinterpretation, a reinforcement of experimental commitment to protect Felix from the contamination of his unnatural inclinations.
"Your interest in my condition may reflect professional responsibility rather than personal consideration," Emil stated, introducing this hypothesis with careful neutrality to establish appropriate distance. "Architectural preservation naturally extends to human welfare within your ethical framework."
Felix's pace faltered slightly, the disruption to his natural grace registering in Emil's awareness with unexpected clarity. "Is that what you think, Emil? That my concern is professional obligation rather than personal investment?"
The question created immediate reinforcement of Emil's internal defenses. The possibility that Felix's concern might indeed transcend professional obligation threatened the protective framework of appropriate distance Emil had constructed—the scientific detachment that preserved both his experimental integrity and Felix from his potentially deviant interpretations.
"Motivation interpretation naturally involves subjective variables," Emil replied, his voice assuming the clinical precision that protected against emotional vulnerability. "Your professional commitment to preservation suggests potential extension to human welfare regardless of personal connection."
Felix stopped entirely, turning to face Emil with an expression he couldn't immediately categorize—a complexity that created uncomfortable awareness in his perception.
"Emil," Felix said quietly, his voice carrying that quality that seemed to bypass normal auditory processing, "my concern for you has nothing to do with professional obligation and everything to do with who you are to me. Not as colleague or subject or academic connection, but as the person I—"
He stopped abruptly, something in his expression suggesting recalculation rather than simple hesitation. The incomplete statement created an unusual awareness in Emil's perception—the unspoken continuation registering with uncomfortable significance despite its absence.
"The person you what?" Emil found himself asking, the direct inquiry representing significant deviation from his typical conversational pattern.
Felix studied him with an intensity that created immediate internal fortification—Emil's scientific detachment providing essential protection against the vulnerability this gaze threatened. The possibility that he was misinterpreting normal friendship through deviant inclination strengthened his commitment to clinical distance—the experimental framework preserving both his protocol integrity and Felix from inappropriate emotional contamination.
"The person I care about beyond any rational explanation or scientific justification," Felix completed, his voice lowered to a register that seemed intimate despite their public location. "The person I cannot bear to watch disappear, whether through Weber's prognosticated illness or the Protégé's collection."
The declaration threatened complete disruption to Emil's protective framework. The emotional precision of Felix's statement created immediate internal conflict—the scientific detachment struggling against the unfamiliar vulnerability this personal investment created. More significantly, the possibility that Emil was corrupting genuine friendship with deviant interpretation reinforced his commitment to the transformation protocol—the structured discipline providing essential protection against inappropriate emotional response.
"Personal investment introduces complicated variables," Emil stated, his voice assuming the clinical coldness that constituted his most effective defense against vulnerability. "Objective assessment becomes increasingly difficult when emotional components interfere with analytical processes."
Felix's expression shifted to something Emil hadn't previously documented in their interactions—a complex combination of exasperation, affection, and persistence that created uncomfortable awareness in his perception.
"Emil," Felix said with unexpected gentleness, "that is possibly the most emotionally stunted response to a declaration of caring I've ever witnessed. And yet from you, I recognize it represents profound discomfort rather than dismissal."
The perceptiveness threatened the protective isolation Emil had carefully constructed. The understanding that Felix could see through his scientific detachment to the emotional vulnerability beneath created immediate internal correction—a reinforcement of experimental commitment to counteract this unprecedented exposure.
"Scientific methodology naturally excludes emotional variables," Emil replied, clinical terminology providing essential protection against the vulnerability Felix's perception created. "Experimental integrity requires objective parameters rather than subjective interpretation."
"Not anymore," Felix responded with quiet certainty. "Not with me witnessing rather than excluded. Not with your isolation disrupted by my participation."
The assertion threatened the fundamental structure of Emil's experimental approach—the protected isolation that allowed both scientific progression and psychological satisfaction his integrated awareness would necessarily have questioned. More significantly, Felix's genuine caring created uncomfortable recognition of Emil's potential deviance—the possibility that he was misinterpreting normal concern through pathological inclination.
The shame of this recognition transformed immediately into reinforced commitment to his experimental protocols—the structured discipline providing not merely scientific purpose but psychological protection against such unnatural impulses. The transformation methodology represented not simply physical refinement but essential barrier against emotional contamination that threatened both his scientific integrity and Felix's unblemished friendship.
As they resumed their walk, completing the calculated route with synchronized steps, Emil felt his internal defenses solidify into complete certainty. Felix's genuine concern, regardless of its actual nature, required appropriate scientific interpretation—the emotional response categorized and contained within experimental parameters that prevented deviant misunderstanding.
Most significantly, the interaction confirmed the essential value of his transformation protocol—the structured discipline providing necessary protection against both external interference and internal vulnerability. The scientific methodology represented not merely experimental procedure but psychological fortress against emotional exposure that threatened his carefully constructed isolation.
"The evening documentation requires specific measurement protocols," Emil stated as they approached Felix's apartment, his voice assuming the clinical coldness that constituted his most effective defense. "The process may appear unnecessarily detailed to non-medical observation."
"I'll observe without interference," Felix replied with immediate understanding. "But afterward, Emil, you will consume actual nourishment rather than the minimal intake you've been documenting as adequate."
The nutritional stipulation created immediate internal resistance. The thought of consuming food beyond his precisely calculated allowance triggered not merely scientific objection but visceral aversion—a profound emotional reaction that confirmed the protocol's psychological rather than purely experimental significance.
"Metabolic requirements follow specific scientific parameters," Emil stated, his voice assuming the cold precision that protected his essential control. "Subjective interpretation naturally distorts objective assessment of nutritional necessity."
Felix's expression suggested he recognized the defensive nature of this response, though his reaction indicated persistence rather than frustration. "Then demonstrate the parameters. Show me the measurements that justify your current intake against your expended energy. Prove the science rather than simply asserting it."
The challenge created immediate internal calculation. The documentation would indeed reveal significant discrepancy between expended energy and consumed nutrition—a deliberate imbalance that constituted a fundamental component of the transformation protocol. The exposure threatened the scientific justification that protected both his experimental approach and his psychological satisfaction.
"Documentation interpretation requires specialized knowledge," Emil replied, selecting scientific objection to mask the profound vulnerability Felix's proposal created. "Contextual understanding naturally affects assessment validity."
"Then explain it," Felix insisted with gentle persistence. "If it's legitimate science rather than self-destruction, then the documentation should demonstrate sustainable balance rather than progressive deterioration."
The logic presented with uncomfortable precision. Emil felt his internal defenses crystallize into absolute certainty—scientific detachment providing essential protection against both Felix's persistence and his own potential deviance. The transformation methodology represented not merely experimental procedure but psychological necessity—the structured discipline preserving both his scientific integrity and Felix from inappropriate emotional contamination.
As they entered the apartment, Emil calculated the strategic requirements of maintaining protocol integrity despite unprecedented observation. Felix's presence necessitated external performance of experimental procedure while preventing the deeper satisfaction the process typically provided—the private sense of control and achievement that constituted the protocol's essential psychological function.
More significantly, Felix's genuine concern created uncomfortable awareness of Emil's potential misinterpretation—the certainty that he was corrupting normal friendship with deviant significance, projecting unnatural inclination onto appropriate collegial concern. The shame of this recognition transformed into absolute commitment to the transformation protocol—the structured discipline providing essential protection against emotional vulnerability that threatened both his scientific detachment and Felix's unblemished friendship.
Emil moved toward the guest room with measured steps, his posture assuming the rigid precision that constituted his most effective physical defense. Felix followed at respectful distance—close enough for observation while maintaining space for implementation. The arrangement created profound vulnerability that Emil countered through immediate reinforcement of his experimental commitment—the scientific methodology providing necessary barrier against the emotional exposure Felix's presence created.
Whatever genuine concern Felix expressed, whatever Weber's medical assessment suggested, whatever the Protégé's interest implied—the transformation protocol represented essential structure against all external interference. The experimental framework provided not merely scientific purpose but psychological protection—the familiar discipline of hunger, measurement, and control constituting the only certainty in an increasingly uncertain existence.
Emil embraced this discipline with renewed commitment, the familiar restriction providing comfort against the unprecedented vulnerability Felix's presence created. The transformation methodology represented not simply physical refinement but essential barrier against emotional contamination that threatened both his scientific integrity and Felix's friendship—the structured protocol protecting each from the deviant misinterpretation Emil now recognized with shameful clarity.
The documentation would proceed with Felix as witness—a significant protocol modification that represented not experimental evolution but defensive necessity, a strategic adaptation to preserve fundamental control despite unprecedented exposure. The isolation that had characterized his transformation methodology had been temporarily disrupted, but the essential discipline remained intact—the structured restriction providing necessary protection against both external interference and internal vulnerability.

Seven-thirty-two in the evening. Emil arranged his measurement instruments with methodical precision across the guest room desk—digital scale positioned for optimal accuracy, measuring tape extended with careful alignment, notebook opened to the appropriate documentation page. Each item had its precise location, each step its calculated sequence—the familiar ritual providing essential structure despite Felix's disruptive presence.
Felix observed from the doorway, his tall frame leaning against the jamb with calculated casualness that nonetheless radiated unusual attentiveness. His gaze followed Emil's preparations with an intensity that created uncomfortable awareness in Emil's perception—not the clinical assessment Weber employed or the predatory observation the Protégé represented, but something more complex that threatened the protective isolation of his experimental procedure.
"The measurement protocol follows specific sequence to ensure data consistency," Emil stated, his voice assuming the clinical detachment that protected against emotional intrusion. "Observation should maintain appropriate distance to prevent equipment interference."
Felix nodded without moving from his position, his expression suggesting internal calculation rather than simple compliance. "I'll remain here unless closer observation becomes necessary for proper documentation."
The conditional nature of this agreement registered with immediate precision. Emil calculated the strategic requirements of maintaining protocol integrity despite unprecedented witness—the procedural adjustments necessary to preserve essential control while under observation.
With methodical movements, Emil removed his jacket and waistcoat, folding each with geometric precision before placing them on the bed. The shirt remained in place—a necessary barrier against complete exposure that preserved both practical measurement access and psychological protection. He positioned himself on the scale with careful alignment, gaze fixed on the numerical display rather than Felix's observing presence.
The digital readout stabilized at 57.3 kilograms.
Emil recorded the figure in his documentation notebook with practiced efficiency, the fountain pen creating precisely formed numbers in the appropriate column. The measurement represented a reduction of 0.4 kilograms from the previous evening's documentation—a progression that confirmed experimental efficacy despite the day's disruptions.
Without acknowledging Felix's continued observation, Emil proceeded to the circumference measurements—the familiar sequence providing essential structure against the unprecedented vulnerability of witnessed procedure. The measuring tape encircled his upper arm with careful alignment, the numerical readout recorded with clinical precision before proceeding to chest, waist, and thigh measurements.
Each figure entered the documentation with methodical efficiency, the accumulated data forming patterns Emil could interpret with scientific detachment—the progressive reduction confirming transformation efficacy through objective metrics rather than subjective assessment. The familiar procedure provided comforting structure despite Felix's disruptive presence, the established protocol preserving essential control within carefully defined parameters.
After completing the physical measurements, Emil moved to physiological documentation—calculating resting pulse with trained precision, recording blood pressure with the portable sphygmomanometer from his medical bag, noting respiratory rate through timed observation. Each figure entered the appropriate column in his documentation notebook, the accumulated data forming comprehensive record of transformation progression.
Throughout the procedure, Emil maintained clinical detachment that protected against the vulnerability Felix's observation created—the scientific methodology providing necessary barrier between experimental documentation and emotional exposure. The familiar ritual preserved essential control despite unprecedented witness, the established protocol functioning as protective framework against both external interference and internal uncertainty.
"The supplementary documentation includes caloric calculation based on measured expenditure patterns," Emil stated upon completing the physical measurements, his voice assuming the professional tone he employed during university lectures. "Daily nutritional intake follows precise balance parameters established through experimental verification."
Felix's expression shifted to something Emil couldn't immediately categorize—a complexity suggesting multiple emotional components beyond his established observational parameters. "And what is tonight's 'nutritional intake' according to these calculations?"
The directness created immediate internal calculation. Emil reviewed the documented measurements against established protocol requirements—the familiar metrics providing objective framework for determining appropriate intake limitations.
"Tonight's calculated nutritional allocation is 417 calories," Emil replied, the precision offering scientific justification against anticipated objection. "The balance maintains optimal transformation progression while providing necessary basic functionality."
"Four hundred and seventeen calories," Felix repeated, his voice carrying unusual weight despite its neutral delivery. "After walking for seventy-three minutes and maintaining professional activities throughout the day. That's your 'scientific' determination of appropriate intake?"
The question contained clear challenge despite its interrogative structure. Emil felt his internal defenses strengthen, scientific detachment providing essential protection against this direct contradiction to his experimental methodology.
"Caloric calculation incorporates multiple physiological variables beyond simple activity measurement," Emil stated, clinical terminology providing familiar structure against emotional exposure. "Metabolic efficiency increases through systematic adjustment of intake parameters."
"Or put another way," Felix responded with unexpected directness, "you're starving yourself with scientific precision while documenting the process with clinical detachment."
The assessment struck with uncomfortable accuracy. Emil felt his internal resistance solidify into absolute certainty—scientific methodology providing necessary protection against this direct threat to his experimental integrity. The transformation protocol represented not merely physical progression but essential psychological structure his carefully constructed framework preserved against external interference.
"Nutritional optimization requires systematic approach rather than subjective interpretation," Emil replied, his voice assuming the cold precision that constituted his most effective defense. "Experimental parameters follow verified scientific methodology rather than conventional assumptions."
Felix straightened from his position against the doorjamb, his full height momentarily dominating the small guest room with unconscious physical presence. "Then it's time for this 'nutritional optimization' you've calculated. Four hundred and seventeen calories, correct? Let's prepare it according to your scientific parameters."
The directive created immediate internal resistance. Emil recognized the strategic trap Felix had constructed—either acquiescence to consuming the calculated intake (which remained significantly above his typical evening consumption) or admission that the documented figure represented deliberate distortion rather than actual intention.
"The preparation can wait until documentation completion," Emil stated, selecting temporary evasion as most strategic given the constraints of the situation. "Protocol sequence prioritizes measurement before consumption."
"The measurements are complete," Felix observed with unexpected persistence. "Your notebook is filled with tonight's figures. According to your own scientific parameters, it's time for the 417 calories you've determined necessary for 'optimal functionality.'"
The logic presented with uncomfortable precision. Emil felt his internal defenses crystallize into absolute rejection—not of the scientific framework but of the external interference this directive represented. The transformation protocol required complete control that Felix's intervention threatened with unprecedented directness.
"Protocol adjustments may be indicated based on today's unusual circumstance," Emil replied, selecting scientific explanation to mask the profound aversion this confrontation created. "Baseline recalculation naturally follows atypical expenditure patterns."
"No recalculation," Felix stated with quiet firmness. "No adjustments. No evasion. Four hundred and seventeen calories—the figure you just calculated and documented as scientifically appropriate. Nothing more, nothing less."
The direct challenge threatened complete disruption to Emil's carefully constructed control. The thought of consuming even his documented allowance—intentionally inflated for potential observation—created not merely scientific objection but visceral revulsion. The response confirmed the protocol's psychological rather than purely experimental significance with uncomfortable clarity.
"I will not alter my established protocol based on external interference," Emil stated, his voice assuming the cold precision that protected his essential control. "Experimental integrity requires methodological consistency regardless of observational variables."
For several seconds, Felix remained motionless, his expression suggesting internal calculation rather than simple reaction. Then, with deliberate movements that Emil immediately categorized as significant, he crossed to the desk and picked up the measuring tape Emil had just used for his documentation.
"What are you doing?" Emil asked, genuine confusion momentarily displacing clinical detachment.
Without responding, Felix extended the measuring tape around his own upper arm, noting the figure with careful precision before recording it in Emil's notebook—the elegant script forming a new column beside Emil's established documentation.
"Felix," Emil stated, his voice carrying unusual sharpness, "you're interfering with experimental documentation."
Again without verbal response, Felix proceeded to measure his own chest circumference, the measuring tape encircling his torso with the same careful alignment Emil had employed for his own measurements. The figure entered the notebook with methodical precision, creating parallel documentation that registered with immediate disturbance in Emil's perception.
"What exactly do you think you're doing?" Emil demanded, scientific detachment temporarily displaced by genuine alarm at this unprecedented disruption to his experimental framework.
Felix looked up from the notebook, his expression carrying that complex quality Emil still couldn't precisely categorize but which created uncomfortable awareness in his perception. "Participating in your experimental protocol. If this is legitimate scientific methodology rather than self-destruction, then it should be equally applicable to multiple subjects."
The explanation struck with disturbing precision. Emil felt immediate internal resistance solidify into absolute rejection—not of the scientific framework but of Felix's participation that threatened both experimental integrity and psychological necessity with unprecedented directness.
"The protocol is calibrated for specific individual parameters," Emil stated, his voice assuming the clinical coldness that constituted his most effective defense against this violation of experimental boundaries. "Methodology application requires specialized adjustment for different physiological baselines."
"Then adjust it," Felix replied with immediate adaptability. "Apply your scientific methodology to my measurements as well. Calculate the appropriate 'transformation progression' for my physiological parameters."
The proposal created immediate internal alarm. The thought of applying his transformation protocol to Felix—of subjecting that natural grace to deliberate diminishment, of imposing calculated restriction on unaffected health—triggered not merely scientific objection but profound protective instinct that contradicted the clinical detachment Emil had carefully maintained throughout his experimental progression.
"The methodology is not transferable between subjects," Emil insisted, the explanation emerging with unusual emotional undertone despite his attempted scientific framing. "Individual variation requires personalized protocol development rather than generalized application."
Felix continued measuring his waist, the figure entering the notebook with methodical precision that mirrored Emil's own documentation process with disturbing accuracy. "But surely scientific methodology should be replicable across subjects. If this is legitimate experimentation rather than self-destruction, it should function equally well when applied to me."
The logic presented with uncomfortable precision. Emil felt unprecedented emotional response disrupt his scientific detachment—not merely objection but authentic alarm at the prospect of Felix subjecting himself to the transformation protocol. The reaction confirmed the methodology's destructive rather than constructive nature with disturbing clarity his clinical framework could no longer entirely obscure.
"The application would be inappropriate given your current physiological parameters," Emil stated, selecting scientific explanation to mask the profound protective instinct this prospect triggered. "Your baseline measurements indicate optimal functionality without methodological intervention."
"And yours didn't?" Felix asked with gentle directness that penetrated more effectively than confrontation could have. "Was your baseline 'suboptimal' in some measurable way that justified this systematic diminishment?"
The question struck with uncomfortable accuracy. Emil felt momentary wavering in his defensive structure—not from the logical argument but from the genuine concern evident in Felix's expression. The realization created immediate internal correction, a tightening of scientific detachment to counteract this emotional vulnerability.
"Baseline optimization represents subjective determination based on multiple physiological variables," Emil replied, clinical terminology providing familiar structure against emotional exposure. "Parameter selection naturally reflects individual assessment rather than standardized criteria."
Felix placed the measuring tape on the desk and extended his wrist toward Emil with deliberate purpose. "Take my pulse," he said quietly. "Complete the physiological measurement sequence according to your established protocol."
The directness created immediate internal conflict. Emil found himself calculating the implications of this participation against the protective isolation of his experimental methodology. The involvement threatened both scientific detachment and psychological necessity with unprecedented intrusion.
"Accurate pulse measurement requires specific preparatory conditions," Emil stated, selecting technical objection to mask his profound discomfort with this procedural violation. "You need to be sitting for some time as well, you are in a state of arousal—"
Emil stopped abruptly, the unfortunate phrasing registering with immediate regret. The potential misinterpretation created uncomfortable awareness of his earlier concern regarding deviant projection—the possibility that he was corrupting normal interaction with inappropriate significance.
Felix's expression shifted momentarily before settling into careful neutrality that nonetheless suggested awareness of the unintended implication. "A state of physical activity, you mean. My heart rate is elevated from movement rather than properly at rest."
"Precisely," Emil acknowledged with careful precision, grateful for the clinical redirection despite his awareness of the underlying awkwardness. "Baseline measurement requires standardized conditions for accurate documentation."
"Then I'll sit," Felix replied with immediate adaptability, moving to the room's single chair with deliberate purpose. "Five minutes of rest should provide adequate stabilization for proper measurement, according to standard medical protocol."
The methodical approach threatened complete disruption to Emil's experimental framework. Felix's systematic participation represented not merely observational interference but active engagement that challenged both scientific isolation and psychological necessity with unprecedented directness.
"Felix," Emil said, his voice carrying unusual emotion despite his attempted clinical framing, "what exactly do you think this will accomplish?"
Felix met his gaze with an intensity that created uncomfortable awareness in Emil's perception—as if the look penetrated beyond scientific detachment to something more essential he had carefully excluded from experimental consideration.
"If there's nothing wrong with what you're doing to yourself," Felix replied with gentle precision, "then there should be nothing wrong with me joining your experiment. If it's legitimate science rather than self-destruction, then my participation should be unobjectionable."
The logic presented with disturbing accuracy. Emil felt unprecedented emotional response disrupt his scientific detachment—not merely resistance but authentic alarm at the prospect of Felix subjecting himself to the transformation protocol. The reaction confirmed the methodology's destructive rather than constructive nature with uncomfortable clarity his clinical framework could no longer entirely disguise.
"Your participation would compromise experimental integrity," Emil insisted, the explanation emerging with unusual emotion despite his attempted scientific framing. "Protocol modification introduces unnecessary variables that affect documentation validity."
"No modification," Felix stated with quiet firmness. "Direct replication. The exact same measurements, calculations, and 'nutritional parameters' you've established for yourself. If it's safe for you, it must be safe for me."
The prospect created immediate internal alarm that manifested as unexpected anger—an emotional response so foreign to Emil's carefully maintained scientific detachment that he initially struggled to categorize it properly. The thought of Felix subjected to deliberate diminishment, to calculated restriction, to progressive weakening, triggered profound protective instinct that contradicted the clinical framework he had applied to his own transformation without hesitation.
"You will not participate in this methodology," Emil stated, his voice carrying unusual force despite his attempted control. "The protocol is not transferable between subjects regardless of measurement compatibility."
Felix's expression suggested he recognized the emotional rather than scientific basis of this objection, though his reaction indicated satisfaction rather than disappointment at this deviation from clinical detachment.
"Why not?" Felix asked with gentle persistence. "If it's legitimate science, why shouldn't I participate? If it's safe enough for you, why isn't it safe enough for me?"
The direct questions penetrated more precisely than Weber's medical assessment or the Protégé's bedside note. Emil felt unprecedented emotional response overwhelm his scientific detachment—not merely objection but authentic panic at the prospect of Felix subjecting himself to the deliberate harm Emil had categorized as transformation.
"Because it would damage you!" Emil exclaimed, the emotional response erupting through his clinical detachment with unexpected force. "Because it would weaken you, diminish you, destroy everything that makes you—"
He stopped abruptly, the unfiltered response registering with immediate regret. The emotional outburst contradicted the scientific framework he had maintained throughout his experimental progression—the clinical detachment that preserved both methodological integrity and psychological necessity against external interference.
Felix's expression shifted to something Emil hadn't previously documented in their interactions—a complex combination of satisfaction, concern, and that persistent quality that continued to defy immediate categorization but which registered as increasingly significant in Emil's awareness.
"But it's not damaging you?" Felix asked with gentle precision that penetrated more effectively than confrontation could have. "It's not weakening you, diminishing you, destroying you? Why would the exact same methodology harm me but help you?"
The logic presented with uncomfortable accuracy. Emil felt his scientific detachment crumbling against this direct contradiction—the protective framework that justified his transformation becoming increasingly unsustainable when applied to someone he actually cared about. The recognition created immediate internal conflict between established experimental commitment and unprecedented emotional recognition.
"The methodology serves different purpose in my application," Emil replied, his voice assuming clinical precision that nonetheless failed to disguise the underlying emotional disruption. "Implementation context naturally affects outcome assessment beyond simple procedural replication."
"What purpose does it serve for you that would be harmful for me?" Felix asked, the directness creating immediate internal calculation. "What context makes systematic self-starvation appropriate for you but inappropriate for me?"
The question struck with disturbing accuracy. Emil felt momentary exposure of his methodology's true nature—not transformation but diminishment, not refinement but destruction, not evolution but calculated disappearance. The recognition threatened both scientific justification and psychological necessity with unprecedented clarity his clinical framework could no longer effectively obscure.
"The protocol optimization reflects individual assessment criteria," Emil stated, selecting scientific explanation to mask the profound vulnerability this exposure created. "Implementation appropriateness naturally varies between subjects based on baseline parameters."
"That's methodology, not purpose," Felix observed with unexpected perceptiveness. "You've explained how it works but not why it should apply to you but not to me."
The distinction created unusual difficulty in Emil's analytical framework. His experimental approach had deliberately focused on procedural precision while avoiding purpose examination—the process documented with scientific detail while its underlying motivation remained carefully unacknowledged even within his private calculations.
"Felix," Emil said after several moments of uncharacteristic hesitation, his voice carrying unusual emotion despite his attempted control, "you will not participate in this protocol regardless of scientific justification or methodological compatibility."
The statement emerged without clinical framing or scientific detachment—a direct prohibition rather than analytical objection, an emotional response rather than calculated assessment. The deviation from his established communication pattern registered with immediate significance in his own awareness, the protective instinct overriding experimental commitment with unprecedented force.
Felix studied him with an intensity that created uncomfortable awareness in Emil's perception—as if the gaze penetrated beyond scientific detachment to the emotional vulnerability he had carefully excluded from experimental consideration.
"Why does that frighten you so much?" Felix asked with gentle directness that penetrated more effectively than confrontation could have. "Why does the thought of me doing exactly what you're doing create such alarm when you defend your own behavior as legitimate science?"
The question struck with uncomfortable accuracy. Emil felt unprecedented emotional response disrupt his scientific detachment—not merely resistance but authentic recognition of his methodology's destructive nature. The framework that justified his transformation became unsustainable when applied to someone he actually valued, the protective isolation that rationalized self-harm collapsing when extended beyond his own diminishment.
"The protocol is not suitable for your implementation," Emil insisted, the explanation emerging with unusual emotion despite his attempted scientific framing. "Your current physiological parameters represent optimal functionality without methodological intervention."
"And yours didn't?" Felix repeated with gentle persistence. "Were you somehow less than optimal before you began this systematic diminishment? What flaw required such dedicated correction through such destructive means?"
The direct questions penetrated more precisely than Felix's earlier challenges. Emil felt momentary exposure of his methodology's underlying motivation—not refinement but punishment, not transformation but control, not evolution but calculated disappearance. The recognition threatened both scientific justification and psychological necessity with uncomfortable clarity his clinical framework could no longer effectively disguise.
"The implementation context differs significantly," Emil stated, selecting abstract explanation to mask the profound vulnerability this exposure created. "Protocol application naturally reflects individualized assessment criteria beyond standardized parameters."
"In simpler terms," Felix said with unexpected gentleness, "you believe you deserve this treatment while I don't. You consider yourself appropriate for systematic destruction while protecting me from the same methodology. What does that tell you about the protocol's true nature, Emil?"
The assessment struck with disturbing precision. Emil felt his scientific detachment crumbling against this direct contradiction—the protective framework that justified his transformation becoming increasingly unsustainable under Felix's persistent questioning. The recognition created immediate internal conflict between established experimental commitment and unprecedented emotional vulnerability.
"The methodology optimization reflects specialized implementation criteria," Emil insisted, though he recognized the reduced conviction in his own assessment. "Protocol application naturally incorporates contextual variables beyond procedural replication."
Felix rose from the chair with unconscious grace, his natural physical economy momentarily dominating Emil's awareness with painful contrast to his own deliberately diminished state. The distinction registered with uncomfortable clarity—Felix's untouched vitality against his own calculated weakening, natural health against systematic destruction.
"I won't force you to eat tonight," Felix said quietly, his voice carrying that quality Emil still couldn't precisely name but which created an unfamiliar response in his own cognitive processes. "I won't physically intervene in your carefully constructed system of self-destruction disguised as science."
The unexpected concession registered with immediate significance. Emil calculated the implications of this apparent retreat against the vulnerability Felix's challenges had created. The withdrawal suggested strategic recalculation rather than simple capitulation, though its exact nature remained uncertain within current interaction parameters.
"Experimental protocols function optimally without external intervention," Emil acknowledged, clinical terminology providing familiar structure despite the emotional disruption Felix's challenges had created. "Methodology consistency naturally supports documentation validity."
"But I will not participate in the pretense that this is science rather than illness," Felix continued with gentle firmness. "I will not observe your self-destruction without intervention indefinitely. And I will not allow you to disappear without fighting for your survival with every resource at my disposal."
The declaration penetrated more deeply than Emil anticipated. He found himself processing its implications with uncharacteristic difficulty, the scientific detachment momentarily inadequate against the emotional complexity of Felix's statement. The genuine concern created uncomfortable awareness of the profound vulnerability his transformation methodology had carefully excluded from experimental consideration.
"The protocol implementation reflects established scientific parameters," Emil stated, his voice assuming the clinical detachment that had proven his most effective defense against emotional intrusion. "Outcome assessment naturally incorporates methodological precision beyond subjective interpretation."
Felix's expression suggested he recognized the defensive nature of this response—the retreat to scientific terminology against emotional exposure, the clinical framework against authentic vulnerability. His reaction indicated neither frustration nor resignation but determined patience that registered with immediate significance in Emil's awareness.
"I'll leave you to your documentation," Felix said quietly, moving toward the door with deliberate purpose. "But this conversation isn't finished, Emil. It's merely postponed until you're ready to acknowledge what we both now recognize about your 'experimental protocol.'"
As Felix departed, Emil remained motionless beside the desk, his scientific detachment temporarily disrupted by unprecedented emotional awareness. The participation challenge had revealed aspects of his transformation methodology his clinical framework had carefully obscured—not refinement but diminishment, not evolution but destruction, not science but illness.
Most significantly, Felix's willingness to subject himself to the same protocol had triggered protective instinct Emil hadn't anticipated—the alarm at potential harm to someone valued contradicting the calculated damage he inflicted on himself without hesitation. The distinction suggested psychological motivation beyond scientific justification with uncomfortable clarity his experimental framework could no longer entirely disguise.
Emil turned toward his documentation notebook, the familiar records providing essential structure against this emotional disruption. The figures presented with scientific precision—measurements, calculations, progressions—yet their meaning had shifted through Felix's persistent questioning. The transformation protocol represented not merely experimental procedure but psychological necessity—the structured discipline preserving essential control despite its increasingly undeniable destructive nature.
The realization created immediate internal fortification—scientific detachment providing necessary protection against this unprecedented vulnerability. The methodology remained essential regardless of its true nature, the discipline representing not merely experimental structure but psychological survival against emotional exposure that threatened both his scientific framework and personal stability with uncomfortable clarity.
Emil completed his documentation with methodical precision, the familiar process providing comforting structure despite the disruption Felix's challenges had created. The transformation would continue without deviation or interference—the protocol representing essential control in an increasingly uncertain existence regardless of its classification as science or illness.
The distinction had lost significance against the procedure's psychological necessity—the methodology providing structure that transcended its justification, the discipline representing survival that required no external validation. The experiment would proceed with or without scientific legitimacy, the transformation continuing with or without Felix's understanding.
Some experiments, once begun, could not be safely terminated regardless of their recognized nature or proven outcome. Some transformations, once initiated, required completion regardless of their acknowledged purpose or demonstrated harm. Some patterns, once established, provided essential structure regardless of their documented destruction or observed consequence.
Emil closed the notebook with careful precision, the familiar action providing comforting finality despite the unprecedented vulnerability Felix's challenges had created. The documentation would continue without distortion or interference—the measurements proceeding with or without observer, the protocol advancing with or without approval, the transformation completing with or without understanding.
Some journeys, once started, permitted no return regardless of destination.


Half past eleven. Emil's pocket watch confirmed the hour with clinical precision as he extracted it from his waistcoat. The apartment held the particular stillness of late evening, broken only by the occasional creak of settling wood and the persistent autumn wind finding seams in the windows.
Felix had insisted Emil stay with him after the discovery of the Protégé's intrusion—the unmistakable evidence that someone had been in Emil's rooms, watching him sleep, leaving those meticulously written notes with their terrible understanding. The thought produced a particular chill that had nothing to do with the room's temperature.
Emil moved with practiced efficiency toward the leather case that contained his instruments. The ritual required privacy, yet privacy was precisely what had been taken from him—first by the Protégé's invasive gaze, and now by Felix's well-intentioned vigilance. He hesitated, aware of Felix's presence in the doorway.
"You need not remain awake on my account," Emil said, his tone measured to suggest reasonable concern rather than the desperate need for solitude the ritual demanded.
"I'm not particularly tired," Felix replied, his casual posture against the doorframe belying the watchfulness in his eyes.
Emil proceeded to unpack his instruments—the brass scale with its precise calibration, the measuring tape coiled like a dormant serpent, the leather-bound notebook. He arranged them with the precision of laboratory preparation.
"Perhaps you might prefer to read in the other room," Emil suggested, keeping his eyes fixed on the instruments.
"I think not."
The quiet certainty in Felix's voice created an unfamiliar disruption in the procedure. Emil felt a familiar tightening in his chest—the pressure of protocol interrupted, the discomfort of observation.
"This will bore you tremendously," Emil said, still not meeting Felix's gaze.
"I doubt that."
Emil removed his jacket with the efficiency of a man changing into surgical garments. The waistcoat followed, then collar and tie, each item carefully placed on a nearby chair. His movements maintained their clinical precision despite the unwanted audience.
Felix remained silent as Emil recorded his weight, the brass scale gleaming in the lamplight. The measuring tape followed—upper arm, chest, waist—each measurement noted with a physician's detachment in the leather-bound book.
"You should be sleeping," Emil said finally, recording the final measurement.
"As should you," Felix replied. "But instead, you intended to go walking, did you not? For no less than two hours in this weather."
Emil did not respond immediately, continuing to note the figures in his precise script. "The protocol requires it," he said finally.
"And what exactly have you eaten today, Emil?"
Emil closed the notebook with careful deliberation. "That is not your concern."
"I believe it has become precisely my concern." Felix moved into the room, no longer merely observing from the threshold. "What have you eaten today?"
Emil met his gaze with professional detachment. "I decline to answer."
Felix moved toward the notebook, his intention clear. Emil felt a surge of panic entirely disproportionate to the action.
"Black coffee this morning," he said quickly. "Clear broth at noon. A small piece of toast at three."
Felix paused, studying him with an expression that made Emil profoundly uncomfortable—not judgment, but something worse: understanding.
"And you don't intend to eat again today."
"That is correct."
At this, something shifted in Felix's expression. He turned abruptly, leaving the room. Emil felt a complex mixture of relief and abandonment, quickly suppressed. But Felix returned moments later carrying his own notebook and the measuring tape Emil had just replaced in its case.
With deliberate movements, Felix removed his own jacket and waistcoat, then began to measure his upper arm circumference.
"What exactly do you think you're doing?" Emil demanded, the clinical detachment dropping from his voice.
Felix continued methodically, recording the measurement before moving to his chest circumference. "Joining you in your protocol," he said simply. "If it's beneficial for you, surely it would be for me as well."
Emil felt a surge of something between rage and terror. "This is absurd."
"Is it?" Felix looked up from his notations. "I've decided I'll match you measurement for measurement, restriction for restriction. You'll walk for two hours in the cold? I'll accompany you. You'll consume only broth and toast? So shall I."
"Stop this immediately." The command emerged sharper than Emil intended.
Felix extended his wrist toward Emil. "My pulse as well, if you would be so kind. Though you need to be sitting for some time for an accurate reading. You are in a state of arousal."
Emil regretted the particular word choice immediately, a flush of heat rising to his face that had nothing to do with the temperature of the room. He took Felix's offered wrist automatically, his fingers finding the radial pulse with professional precision. The steady beat beneath his fingertips registered alongside the unwelcome awareness of Felix's skin against his own.
He released Felix's wrist and stepped back. "Seventy-four beats per minute. Slightly elevated."
Felix recorded this calmly. "And now, shall we prepare for our walk?"
"I prohibit your participation in this," Emil said, his voice taut.
"You have no choice in the matter." Felix's tone remained even. "If your protocol is medically sound, I see no reason why I shouldn't adopt it myself."
Emil recognized with horror that Felix was using his own methodology against him, transforming the private ritual into a grotesque mirror. "This is unnecessary."
"Why is it acceptable for you but not for me?" Felix asked, his voice gentle but unyielding. "Explain the difference, Emil. As a medical professional."
The words caught in Emil's throat, strangled by the terrible logic of the question. The answer, when it finally emerged, was barely audible. "You are already physically optimal. A reduction would be harmful."
"And you?" Felix asked softly.
Emil turned away, unable to maintain the clinical detachment required to continue the conversation. The brass instruments on the desk reflected the lamplight in distorted patterns. His carefully constructed professional distance crumbled beneath the weight of Felix's simple question.
Behind him, he heard Felix replace the measuring tape in its case. The sound held a terrible finality.
"I'm still accompanying you on your walk," Felix said, his voice closer now. "And tomorrow, we'll discuss what we're both going to eat."
Emil did not turn. The protocol, disrupted now beyond repair for the evening, offered no guidance for this unexpected deviation. Outside, the wind continued its persistent examination of the window seams, seeking entry with the same relentless precision as Felix's questions.
The pocket watch on the desk marked eleven forty-five with indifferent accuracy. In fifteen minutes, he should be walking through the night streets of Prague, counting steps and minutes with mathematical precision. Instead, he stood frozen between Felix and his instruments, trapped in the terrible space between protocol and truth.

Emil reached for his shirt, his movements more abrupt than their usual precision warranted. The fine tremor in his hands made the buttons difficult. He was acutely aware of Felix's gaze, the weight of observation he had so carefully avoided for years.
"We should depart promptly if we are to maintain schedule," Emil said, forcing his voice into the pattern of professional authority that had served him for so long.
Felix nodded, retrieving his own coat. "Of course. The protocol must be observed."
The subtle emphasis on the word "protocol" carried an undercurrent of irony that Emil chose to ignore. He completed dressing with methodical focus, though each layer felt unusually heavy against his frame.
Outside, the autumn night greeted them with a biting wind that slipped beneath collars and cuffs with practiced ease. The gaslights cast pools of yellow illumination at measured intervals, stretching down the empty street in perfect perspective, a physician's diagram of urban planning.
"Your usual route?" Felix asked, falling into step beside him.
"Yes." Emil set a pace that experience had calculated as optimal—swift enough to elevate heart rate, measured enough to sustain for the required duration. Felix matched him stride for stride.
The first thirty minutes passed in silence, broken only by their footsteps against cobblestones and the occasional carriage in the distance. Emil maintained his focus on the internal count of steps, the careful calculation of energy expenditure, the measured rhythm of his breathing.
At precisely fifty-two minutes into their walk, Emil became aware of an uncomfortable lightness in his head, a familiar precursor he typically managed with practiced adjustments to his pace. He slowed imperceptibly, but Felix noticed immediately.
"Are you well?" he asked, the question carrying more weight than its simple syllables suggested.
"Perfectly," Emil replied, increasing his pace slightly to demonstrate the truth of his statement.
The streets had transformed from the familiar territory of daily transit to something more demanding—each cobblestone requiring specific attention, each corner approaching with unexpected speed. Emil found himself concentrating on the simple mechanics of walking with an intensity usually reserved for complex surgical procedures.
At one hour and seventeen minutes, the tremor in his hands had become more pronounced. He clasped them behind his back in the posture of a man deep in thought rather than one fighting to maintain control of his extremities.
"Perhaps we might rest briefly," Felix suggested, indicating a bench positioned beneath a gaslight.
"Unnecessary," Emil replied, though the bench had acquired a peculiar significance in his vision, expanding and contracting slightly with each heartbeat. "The protocol specifically precludes rest periods."
Felix said nothing but remained close beside him as they continued. Emil became aware that their pace had slowed considerably despite his efforts to maintain it. More concerning, the precise count of steps he had maintained had been lost somewhere in the previous block—a failure of protocol that would require notation.
At one hour and thirty-two minutes, the buildings along the street began to perform a slow, stately rotation around him. Emil stopped abruptly, placing one hand against a lamppost to steady himself.
"A momentary adjustment," he explained, his voice sounding distant to his own ears.
"Emil," Felix's voice came from beside him, but the sound seemed to arrive through water. "This ends now. We're returning."
"Impossible. The protocol requires—"
"Damn your protocol."
Felix's uncharacteristic sharpness penetrated the increasing fog. Emil turned to respond and found the street tilting at an impossible angle. His legs, those unreliable instruments, began to fold beneath him.
Felix caught him before he could collapse completely, supporting him with a strength that Emil found both humiliating and strangely comforting.
"I am perfectly capable—" Emil began, but the words scattered like loose papers in wind.
"Yes, remarkably capable of killing yourself with scientific precision," Felix said, his voice tight with an emotion Emil could not properly catalog in his current state.
The return journey occurred in a series of disjointed fragments—Felix's arm supporting him, the scrape of his own feet against cobblestone, the spinning constellations of gaslights and stars overhead. Emil made several attempts to restore his professional composure, each less successful than the last.
By the time they reached Felix's apartment, Emil could no longer disguise the tremors that ran through his body. The stairs presented a challenge of mountainous proportions. Felix maintained his supporting grip without comment, his breathing the only indication of the effort involved.
Inside, Emil found himself guided to a chair, his body responding with the passive compliance of a specimen rather than the willful direction of a researcher. The room performed slow, lazy rotations around him.
"Sit still," Felix instructed, his voice coming from a great distance. "I'm going to make tea."
Emil intended to protest that tea was not indicated in the protocol at this hour, but found the words had dissolved before reaching his tongue. He concentrated instead on maintaining his seated position, a task requiring unexpected focus.
When Felix returned with the tea, Emil found his hands trembling too severely to accept the cup. Felix placed it on the side table without comment, observing him with the careful attention Emil recognized from his own clinical practice.
"This is temporary," Emil managed, his voice thin. "A minor metabolic adjustment."
"Is that the medical term for starvation?" Felix asked quietly.
Emil attempted to straighten in the chair, to reassume the posture of professional authority. "You are being dramatic. This is simply—"
The sentence remained unfinished as the room suddenly accelerated its rotation. Emil felt a peculiar distance opening between his mind and body, a clinical detachment of an entirely different nature than he had cultivated. He was aware of slipping sideways in the chair, of Felix moving quickly toward him, and then of nothing at all.
He regained awareness in gradual layers—first the sensation of being horizontal rather than vertical, then the weight of a blanket, then the texture of a pillow beneath his head. The ceiling above him was unfamiliar for several moments before resolving into Felix's sitting room. He had been placed on the sofa.
"Welcome back," Felix said from somewhere to his left.
Emil turned his head carefully, finding Felix seated beside the sofa, his expression grave in the lamplight. The motion sent another wave of dizziness through him.
"How long?" Emil asked, his voice barely above a whisper.
"Only a few minutes," Felix replied. "Though I suspect you've been unconscious for much longer than that in other ways."
Emil closed his eyes, unable to face the quiet certainty in Felix's gaze. The professional edifice he had maintained for so long lay in ruins around him, as exposed and vulnerable as his body felt beneath the blanket.
"This changes nothing," he said finally, the words emerging with effort.
"It changes everything," Felix countered softly. "You collapsed in my arms, Emil. I felt every bone. I could count your ribs through your shirt. I—" He stopped abruptly, collecting himself. "This is not a researcher's experiment. This is not a protocol. This is a slow suicide, documented with scientific precision."
Emil kept his eyes closed, finding refuge in the darkness behind his eyelids. "You don't understand."
"Then help me understand. Not as a colleague or fellow researcher. As someone who—" Felix hesitated, choosing his words with careful deliberation. "As someone who cares for you deeply."
The simple statement penetrated Emil's defenses more effectively than any medical argument could have. He opened his eyes, finding Felix's gaze fixed upon him with an intensity that made him acutely aware of his own fragility.
"I can't," Emil whispered, the admission torn from somewhere beneath the careful layers of professional identity he had constructed.
"You can," Felix replied, his voice gentle but firm. "And you must. Because I won't watch you disappear before my eyes. Not when the Protégé threatens you from without, and not when you destroy yourself from within."
Emil turned his face away, unable to maintain contact with Felix's earnest gaze. The tremors had subsided somewhat, but he remained acutely aware of his body's betrayal—the weakness in his limbs, the irregular flutter of his pulse, the hollow spaces between his bones where his carefully maintained protocol had carved away everything but the essential framework.
"Tomorrow," Felix said quietly, "we begin again. And we begin differently."
Emil said nothing, his silence neither agreement nor refusal. Outside, the wind continued its examination of the windows, persistent and thorough. Inside, the protocol lay shattered around him, its fragments as sharp and dangerous as broken glass.

Morning arrived with violent insistence. Rain lashed against the windows in horizontal sheets, driven by a wind that howled through the narrow streets of Prague with animal intensity. The leaden sky cast the apartment in a perpetual twilight, requiring lamps despite the hour.
Emil woke to the sound of water striking glass with military precision, each drop a small explosion. His body felt impossibly heavy, as though the blankets had been replaced with lead sheets during the night. The humiliation of the previous evening's collapse remained acute, a wound more painful than the physical weakness that had caused it.
He pushed himself to a seated position, moving with the careful deliberation of an invalid. The room held steady, a minor victory. From the kitchen came the sound of movement—Felix, already awake.
Emil located his pocket watch on the side table. Seven forty-three. The protocol had been irreparably breached; the morning measurements should have been completed precisely at six-thirty. The recognition of this failure produced a familiar constriction in his chest, a tightening that had nothing to do with his physical condition.
He stood carefully, testing his balance before attempting to cross to the chair where his clothes had been neatly folded. The simple act of dressing required his complete concentration, each button a separate challenge for fingers that refused to operate with their usual precision.
When he emerged from the bedroom, he found Felix in the kitchen, his back to the door as he attended to something on the stove. The familiar measuring instruments—scale, tape, notebook—had been arranged on the small table with medical precision.
"Good morning," Felix said without turning. "The weather has decided to match our mood, it seems."
Emil approached the table, drawn to the instruments with the inevitability of ritual. "I see you've prepared the materials."
"Yes," Felix replied, turning now with a cup of something steaming in his hand. "For both of us."
The echo of the previous night's confrontation hung between them. Emil reached for the notebook, needing the comfort of documentation, of control through recording. The pages fell open to recent entries, the neat columns of figures tracking his slow disappearance with scientific accuracy.
Felix placed the cup on the table. "Tea. I thought we might both need it before we begin."
Emil noted the deliberate use of "we" but did not comment. He took the cup automatically, the warmth against his palms providing unexpected comfort against the chill that seemed to have taken permanent residence in his bones.
Outside, a particularly violent gust of wind drove rain against the windows with percussive force. The storm's raw energy provided a stark contrast to the precise, controlled ritual about to unfold in the kitchen.
"Shall we proceed?" Emil asked, placing the tea aside and reaching for the scale with the practiced movement of a surgeon selecting an instrument.
Felix nodded, setting down his own cup. "Together, as agreed."
Emil felt a flicker of irritation. "Nothing was agreed."
"Your collapse on the public street suggests otherwise," Felix replied, his tone conversational but unyielding. "After you."
With the resignation of a man proceeding to his own execution, Emil stepped onto the scale. The brass weights slid along their track with familiar precision, settling at a figure that produced no reaction on his face but caused Felix to inhale sharply.
"Your turn," Emil said, stepping off the platform.
Without hesitation, Felix took his place. Emil adjusted the weights, noting the figure in the book with clinical detachment. The disparity between their measurements created a scientific record of Emil's condition more damning than any medical diagnosis.
They proceeded to the measuring tape. Emil removed his dressing gown, standing in shirtsleeves and trousers as Felix recorded the circumference of his upper arm, chest, and waist. The contact of the tape against him, even through fabric, felt invasive in a way it never had during his solitary ritual.
When it came time to measure Felix, Emil found himself confronted with an unexpected difficulty. Felix stood before him in his own shirtsleeves, waiting for the measurement to begin. Emil extended the tape toward Felix's upper arm, maintaining professional detachment with considerable effort.
"Forty-one centimeters," Emil noted, recording the figure. He proceeded to chest and waist measurements with the efficiency of a physician, though he found himself acutely aware of Felix's solid presence beneath the measuring tape—the antithesis of his own carefully reduced form.
The measurements complete, Emil returned to the notebook, regarding the columns of figures with the dispassion of a researcher examining experimental results. Felix moved to look over his shoulder, his proximity causing Emil to tense imperceptibly.
"A rather stark contrast, wouldn't you say?" Felix observed quietly.
Emil closed the notebook. "Individual physicality varies considerably based on numerous factors."
"Indeed," Felix agreed, his tone suggesting they both recognized the inadequacy of the response. "And now the final element of your morning protocol, I believe. You typically consume black coffee at this hour?"
Emil nodded, the familiar tightening in his chest returning at the prospect of food. "It is sufficient."
"Then we shall both have exactly that." Felix moved to the stove, where the coffee pot waited. "And nothing more until noon, at which point we will both consume clear broth. And in the evening, we will both eat half a slice of dry toast. Is that correct?"
The methodical recitation of his own restrictions, spoken in Felix's matter-of-fact tone, created a strange doubling effect—as though Emil were simultaneously practitioner and subject, observer and observed.
"You are being deliberately provocative," Emil said.
"I am taking you at your word," Felix countered, pouring coffee into two cups. "If this regimen is medically sound for you, surely it must be for me as well."
He placed both cups on the table, seating himself across from Emil with calm deliberation. Outside, the storm continued its assault, rain striking the windows with such force it seemed determined to breach the glass.
Emil stared into the black surface of his coffee, seeing his own distorted reflection. "This accomplishes nothing."
"On the contrary," Felix said, lifting his cup. "It accomplishes a great deal. Either we both maintain your protocol, or we both adopt something less likely to result in collapse on public streets."
"I told you, that was a temporary—"
"A temporary metabolic adjustment. Yes, I recall." Felix's voice remained even, but his eyes held Emil's with uncomfortable intensity. "Is that also your explanation for the fact that I could feel every vertebra in your spine when I carried you up the stairs last night?"
Emil looked away, unable to maintain contact with Felix's direct gaze. The rain provided a convenient distraction, its chaotic patterns against the glass contrasting with the ordered precision of the morning's measurements.
"Your concern is noted," Emil said finally, adopting the tone he reserved for overly anxious patients. "But unnecessary."
"Is it?" Felix asked softly. He reached across the table, his hand entering Emil's field of vision. With deliberate slowness, he placed his wrist alongside Emil's where it rested on the table.
The contrast was immediately, viscerally apparent. Felix's wrist, solid and substantial; Emil's, reduced to its essential architecture, the bones visible beneath skin like anatomical specimens partially excavated.
"Look at us, Emil," Felix said, his voice gentle but insistent. "Not as a physician observing a subject, nor as a researcher documenting an experiment. Look as a man seeing his own reflection."
Emil found he could not look away from their juxtaposed wrists. The clinical detachment he had maintained for so long wavered, a brief glimpse of reality breaking through the carefully constructed narrative he had built around his condition.
"What do you see?" Felix asked.
Emil withdrew his arm, tucking his hand beneath the table where it would be hidden from both their views. "I see that you are allowing emotional concerns to override rational observation."
Felix shook his head slowly. "What I find most remarkable," he said, "is that for a man of such exceptional observational skills, you are completely blind to your own condition."
Something in his tone caused Emil to look up sharply. Felix was regarding him with an expression that contained no trace of judgment, only a profound sadness.
"What exactly do you mean?" Emil asked, his voice tight.
"I mean," Felix said carefully, "that you perceive me as thinner than yourself."
The statement hung in the air between them, its implications expanding to fill the small kitchen. Outside, thunder rumbled in the distance, a low counterpoint to the persistent drumming of rain.
"That is absurd," Emil said finally, but the words lacked conviction even to his own ears.
"Is it?" Felix reached for the notebook, opening it to the morning's entries. "The measurements are quite clear. Yet when you look at me, you see someone slender, perhaps even lean. When you look at yourself—" He hesitated, choosing his words with care. "What do you see, Emil?"
The question penetrated deeper than Emil expected, breaching defenses he had maintained for years. He looked down at his hands, now clearly visible to him beneath the table. The prominent knuckles, the visible tendons, the architectural precision of bone beneath skin—all registered with sudden, terrible clarity.
"I see a man maintaining optimal efficiency," he said, but the practiced response sounded hollow even to himself.
Felix closed the notebook gently. "And I see a man disappearing before my eyes."
The simple statement, delivered without drama or accusation, created a fracture in Emil's carefully maintained facade. He found himself suddenly, acutely aware of his physical state in a way that bypassed his usual scientific detachment—the persistent cold, the constant tremor, the effort required for even the simplest tasks.
"The protocol is necessary," he said, his voice barely audible above the rain.
"The protocol is killing you," Felix replied softly. "And I won't watch it happen. Not while the Protégé stalks you from without, and certainly not while you destroy yourself from within."
Emil looked up, meeting Felix's gaze with difficulty. "What exactly do you propose?"
"That we begin differently, as I said last night. Both of us." Felix pushed his coffee cup aside, leaning forward with the intensity of a man proposing a scientific breakthrough. "We eat regular meals, together. We document your recovery with the same precision you've documented your decline. We face the Protégé as equals, not as predator and weakened prey."
The storm outside had reached a crescendo, rain and wind combining in chaotic harmony. Inside, Emil felt a corresponding turbulence—the ordered patterns of years threatening to dissolve beneath Felix's steady gaze and unwavering presence.
"And if I refuse?" he asked, though he already knew the answer.
"Then I match you step for step," Felix said simply."Every restriction, every deprivation, every dangerous ritual. Until you recognize what you're doing through watching it happen to someone else."
The terrible logic of it struck Emil with unexpected force. He studied Felix's face, searching for signs of insincerity or manipulation, finding only resolute determination.
"That would be both foolish and pointless," Emil replied, falling back on the authority of his medical training. "Your body has different requirements, different baselines. The comparison would be scientifically invalid."
Felix maintained his steady gaze. "I'm not proposing a scientific experiment, Emil. I'm making a choice."
"A choice I strongly advise against, as a medical professional."
"And yet you make this choice daily." Felix's voice remained even, without accusation.
Emil stood carefully, maintaining his equilibrium through practiced control. "You cannot understand the necessity of my protocol. I've developed it through years of careful calibration."
"Then explain it to me," Felix challenged. "Help me understand why it's essential for you but dangerous for me."
"Some matters lie beyond explanation," Emil replied, retreating to the safety of professional distance. "Now, if you'll excuse me, I have work to attend to."
Felix nodded slowly. "As do I. But from this moment, I follow your protocol precisely. Whatever you consume, I consume. Whatever you deny yourself, I deny myself."
Emil recognized the stubborn set of Felix's jaw, a familiar indicator that further argument would prove futile. He nodded curtly and retreated to the small desk in the corner of the sitting room, where his papers awaited attention. Behind him, he heard Felix clear the table with deliberate care, the measuring implements returned to their leather case.
The storm continued throughout the day, confining them to the apartment. They worked in separate corners—Emil at the desk, Felix at his drafting table—maintaining a careful distance that was both physical and emotional. At noon, Emil prepared two cups of clear broth, placing one beside Felix without comment. Felix accepted it with equal silence, consuming only the few spoonfuls Emil did.
By evening, the weather showed no signs of abating. Rain continued to lash against the windows, the wind finding new voices in the eaves and chimneys of the building. Emil consulted his pocket watch with growing unease. Seven thirty. The evening walk, a non-negotiable element of his protocol, was due to commence in precisely thirty minutes.
Felix looked up from his drawing as Emil rose and began preparations. "You intend to walk in this?" he asked, though his tone suggested he already knew the answer.
"The protocol requires it," Emil replied simply, reaching for his coat.
Without comment, Felix set aside his work and retrieved his own coat.
They descended the stairs in silence, emerging into a night rendered hostile by wind and rain. The storm had emptied the streets; they encountered no other pedestrians as they set out along Emil's prescribed route. Water immediately penetrated their clothing despite their coats, the wind driving rain beneath collars and cuffs with scientific precision.
Emil maintained his usual pace through force of will, counting steps and minutes with practiced accuracy despite the weather's attempts to disrupt his rhythm. Felix remained beside him, matching his stride without complaint, though Emil noted the slight shiver that occasionally passed through his companion's frame.
After precisely two hours, they returned to the apartment, both soaked to the skin despite their protective layers. Emil removed his wet clothing with clinical efficiency, changing into dry garments before recording the evening's data in his notebook. Felix followed suit, though Emil observed that his movements lacked their usual fluid grace.
They retired to separate rooms without further discussion, though sleep proved elusive for Emil. He lay awake listening to the storm, aware of the slight tremor in his limbs that never fully subsided, the hollow sensation beneath his ribs, the precise architecture of bone beneath skin.

The second day dawned with undiminished fury, the storm having settled over Prague with apparent determination to remain. Emil rose at his customary hour, completing his morning measurements before Felix emerged from his room. The figures, recorded with scientific detachment, showed no significant change from the previous day.
Felix appeared as Emil was preparing the morning coffee. Emil noted immediately the slight pallor beneath his normally healthy complexion, the subtle reduction in his usual energetic movements.
"Did you sleep well?" Emil inquired, falling into the patterns of polite inquiry that masked genuine concern.
"Not particularly," Felix admitted, accepting the cup of black coffee Emil extended toward him. "Dreams were rather... fragmented."
Emil nodded. "An expected side effect of reduced glucose availability. The brain becomes more active during REM sleep as it seeks alternative energy sources."
Felix regarded him over the rim of his cup. "You speak from experience, I presume."
"From both research and observation," Emil replied, retreating to the security of scientific discourse.
They worked separately through the morning, though Emil found himself increasingly aware of subtle changes in Felix's behavior—the occasional pause in his drawing, moments when his gaze would lose focus, the increased frequency with which he rubbed his temples.
At noon, Emil again prepared two cups of broth. Felix accepted his without comment, though Emil observed he consumed even less than the previous day.
By afternoon, the changes in Felix had become more pronounced. His usual fluid movements had acquired a deliberate quality, as though each action required specific concentration. His normally animated expressions had flattened, replaced by a kind of remote abstraction.
"You're experiencing the early stages of ketosis," Emil observed as Felix stared out the window at the unrelenting storm.
Felix turned slowly. "Is that the medical term for feeling as though one's thoughts are moving through molasses?"
"That's an apt description," Emil acknowledged. "The body is transitioning from glucose to ketone bodies as its primary energy source. The brain protests the change."
"And this is what you experience daily?" Felix asked, his usual sharp insight momentarily visible through the metabolic fog.
"One becomes accustomed to it," Emil replied, avoiding the direct question.
The evening walk proved even more challenging than the previous night's. The storm had intensified, wind driving rain horizontally through the streets. Felix stumbled twice, his normally perfect coordination compromised by the day's restrictions. Emil found himself unconsciously adjusting their route to include more sheltered streets, a deviation from protocol he chose not to record.
Upon returning, Felix retired immediately, forgoing his usual evening reading. Emil noted the departure from routine without comment, recording the day's observations in his journal with clinical precision.

The third day brought subtle changes to the storm—less rain, but wind that seemed to have found new strength, howling around buildings and rattling windows with increased determination. Emil rose to find Felix already awake, seated at the kitchen table with a cup of black coffee before him, untouched.
"Good morning," Emil offered, noting the pronounced shadows beneath Felix's eyes, the slight tremor in his hand as he raised it in acknowledgment.
"Is it?" Felix replied, his usual eloquence reduced to bare essentials. "Morning, certainly. Good remains to be determined."
Emil prepared his own coffee in silence, observing Felix with the detached interest of a researcher. The changes were becoming more pronounced—weight loss not yet visible to the casual observer but evident to Emil's practiced eye in the slightly sharper definition of cheekbones, the more prominent tendons in his hands.
Their work that day progressed in fits and starts. Emil found himself frequently glancing toward Felix, noting the increasing periods during which Felix would simply stare at his drawing, pencil motionless in his hand, thoughts clearly elsewhere.
"The concentration difficulties typically peak during this phase," Emil commented during one such episode.
Felix looked up, blinking as though emerging from deep water. "What were you saying?"
"The cognitive effects," Emil repeated. "They're most pronounced at this stage. The brain is protesting its changing fuel source."
"You speak of it with such clinical detachment," Felix observed, his words coming more slowly than usual. "As though discussing a laboratory specimen rather than your own experience."
Emil avoided the implicit question, returning to his papers with deliberate focus.
By evening, conversation had become minimal, both men operating in the strange, detached state that Emil knew intimately—a kind of ethereal distance from physical reality, where thoughts seemed simultaneously sharper and more fragmented.
The evening walk was shortened by mutual, unspoken consent as the wind reached dangerous levels, tearing roof tiles from nearby buildings and sending them crashing to the streets below.
"This protocol," Felix said as they removed their coats, his voice carrying the slightly dreamlike quality characteristic of advanced ketosis, "it consumes more than physical reserves, doesn't it?"
Emil paused, the question penetrating his professional detachment with unexpected force. "It requires certain adaptations," he acknowledged carefully.
"Not adaptations," Felix corrected, his usual precision of language briefly reasserting itself. "Sacrifices."
Emil had no response to offer that wouldn't betray the carefully maintained narrative he had constructed around his condition.

The fourth morning dawned with unexpected silence. The storm had finally exhausted itself, leaving behind a washed-out sky of delicate gray. Emil completed his morning measurements and documentation, noting the continued stability of his own figures alongside the progressive changes in Felix's.
When Felix failed to appear by eight o'clock, Emil approached his bedroom door, concern briefly overriding his usual respect for privacy.
"Felix?" he called, knocking lightly.
A muffled response came from within. Emil hesitated, then opened the door with careful deliberation.
The room was dim, curtains still drawn against the morning light. Felix lay on the bed, still dressed in his nightclothes, an arm thrown across his eyes.
"Are you unwell?" Emil asked, medical assessment automatically engaging.
Felix lowered his arm slightly, regarding Emil through eyes that seemed to have receded further into their sockets overnight. "I find I lack the immediate motivation to rise," he said, each word measured and precise despite his condition. "How do you manage this, Emil? Day after day, month after month?"
The question contained no accusation, only genuine curiosity. Emil approached the bed slowly, medical concern momentarily displacing the boundaries he typically maintained.
"Your pulse," he said, reaching for Felix's wrist with professional detachment.
Felix offered no resistance as Emil counted the beats, noting the rhythm slightly slower than normal but still within acceptable parameters.
"You haven't answered my question," Felix said quietly. "How do you manage this daily? This... emptiness. This distance from everything."
Emil released his wrist, medical assessment complete. "One adapts," he said, the answer clearly insufficient even to himself.
"That's not an explanation," Felix persisted. "It's an evasion."
Emil found himself suddenly, acutely aware of Felix's vulnerability—not merely physical, but the emotional exposure inherent in allowing another to witness one's weakened state. A strange reciprocity had developed between them, roles of observer and observed constantly shifting.
Without conscious decision, Emil sat on the edge of the narrow bed. The mattress dipped slightly beneath his weight, causing Felix to shift position to maintain distance between them.
"You should rest," Emil said, falling back on medical recommendation in the absence of more personal response.
"I'm not certain I could do otherwise," Felix admitted, his voice carrying the particular quality of detachment Emil recognized intimately—the strange separation between mind and body that advanced restriction produced.
The morning light filtered through the curtains, casting the room in diffuse gray that matched the washed-out sky beyond. Emil became aware of his own physical state—the persistent cold, the never-quite-suppressed tremor, the hollow spaces between his ribs—with unusual clarity.
Before he entirely registered his actions, Emil found himself lying down beside Felix on the narrow bed. He told himself it was merely to continue his medical assessment, to monitor Felix's condition more closely, but the justification felt hollow even within his own mind.
Felix made no comment on this unprecedented breach of boundaries, simply shifting slightly to accommodate Emil's presence. They lay side by side in silence, two figures rendered in the same gray palette as the morning light.
"How do you manage this?" Felix asked again, his voice barely above a whisper. "Day after day?"
Emil stared at the ceiling, aware of Felix beside him, of the strange intimacy of shared deprivation. He had put on Felix's dressing gown over his shirtsleeves and trousers, seeking warmth that remained elusive regardless of layers.
"I don't know, really," he answered finally, the honesty of the response surprising even himself. "I suppose you just get used to it."
He felt rather than saw Felix turn his head, sensed the weight of his gaze.
"Used to it," Felix repeated, the three simple words containing volumes of understanding. "Used to feeling half-alive. Used to being cold regardless of the temperature. Used to thoughts that never quite connect properly."
Emil continued to stare at the ceiling, unable to meet Felix's eyes. "Yes," he said simply.
"Emil," Felix said, his voice carrying a tenderness that penetrated the fog of ketosis, "no one should get used to this."
The simple statement, delivered without judgment or accusation, created a fracture in Emil's carefully maintained facade. He became aware of a pressure behind his eyes, a tightness in his throat that had nothing to do with his physical condition.
"It's necessary," he said, the words sounding hollow even to himself.
"Why?" Felix asked softly.
The question hung in the air between them, both simple and impossibly complex. Emil found himself without the energy to construct his usual scientific justifications, his careful edifice of rationalization crumbling beneath the weight of Felix's genuine concern.
"I don't know anymore," he admitted finally, the words emerging from some place beyond his conscious control.
Felix's hand found his, fingers wrapping around Emil's with careful deliberation. The contact—skin against skin, warmth against perpetual cold—registered with startling clarity. Emil knew he should withdraw, maintain the boundaries of propriety and professional distance, but found himself lacking the will to break the connection.
"Then perhaps," Felix said, his voice gentle but firm despite his weakened state, "it's time to find another way."
Emil turned finally to look at him, finding Felix's gaze steady despite the exhaustion evident in every line of his face. The vulnerability of the moment—both of them weakened, defenses lowered by hunger and fatigue—created a strange intimacy unlike anything Emil had experienced.
He was acutely aware of Felix's proximity, of the slight pressure of his hand, of the concern in his eyes that Emil had consistently misinterpreted as judgment. The realization that he might have been wrong about this—might have been wrong about many things—was too overwhelming to fully process in his current state.
"I don't know how," Emil confessed, the admission torn from somewhere beneath the layers of professional identity and careful control he had constructed.
"Then we'll discover it together," Felix replied, his fingers tightening slightly around Emil's. "But not like this. Not through starvation and exhaustion."
They lay in silence for some minutes, side by side on the narrow bed, connected by the slight pressure of hands. Emil found himself unable to construct a counter-argument, his usual eloquence and scientific precision abandoned in the face of Felix's simple, devastating logic.
"Rest now," Emil said finally, professional concern reasserting itself. "Your body needs time to recover."
"As does yours," Felix countered softly. "Though you refuse to acknowledge it."
Emil made no response, aware that any argument would ring hollow in the face of their shared physical reality. The morning light had strengthened, filtering through the curtains to cast the room in shades of pearl and silver. Outside, Prague emerged from the storm, water dripping from eaves and gutters in diminishing rhythm.
They remained there, side by side, two figures rendered in the same pale palette, connected by the slight pressure of hands and the shared experience of voluntary deprivation—one familiar with its empty landscape, the other newly acquainted with its desolate terrain.

The fifth day brought a strange, restless energy to them both. Emil woke from fragmented sleep to find his limbs infused with a jittery alertness that belied their weakness. He completed his morning measurements with clinical efficiency, noting the slight downward shift in his own figures with detached interest. Felix's measurements, taken while he stood with uncharacteristic stillness, showed a more dramatic decline, though they remained significantly higher than Emil's.
Despite this objective reality, Emil found himself studying Felix's form with a peculiar mixture of envy and confusion. The rational part of his mind acknowledged the mathematical evidence before him—Felix's measurements exceeded his own by substantial margins—yet his perception insisted otherwise. He saw Felix as lean, perfectly proportioned, while his own body remained somehow excessive despite all evidence to the contrary.
"Your pulse is elevated," Emil noted as he pressed his fingers to Felix's wrist, the professional observation masking his discomfort with their proximity after the previous day's unprecedented intimacy.
"As is yours," Felix replied, his eyes unusually bright in his increasingly hollow face. "A common effect at this stage, I imagine?"
Emil nodded, releasing Felix's wrist. "The body increases production of certain hormones in response to prolonged restriction. A survival mechanism, essentially."
"Feels rather like having consumed too much coffee," Felix observed, his fingers tapping an irregular rhythm against his thigh. "A strange contradiction—exhaustion and energy simultaneously."
Emil recognized the description with uncomfortable familiarity. "It will pass," he said, though the statement was not entirely truthful. This particular state—the restless energy, the heightened sensitivity, the strange, ethereal detachment—was one he had cultivated for years.
They settled into work, though neither maintained focus for long. Emil found himself rising frequently, pacing the small apartment before returning to his papers. Felix exhibited similar restlessness, shifting between his drafting table and the window, his usual fluid grace acquired a sharp, almost birdlike quality.
"I've been considering the Protégé's possible identity," Felix said during one such circuit of the room. His speech had acquired a rapid, slightly disjointed pattern that Emil recognized as characteristic of this phase. "Several candidates present themselves based on the evidence at hand."
Emil looked up from his notes. "You've made progress in our absence from the archives?"
"Not new evidence," Felix clarified, his hands moving in quick, precise gestures. "Rather, new patterns in existing observations. Connections previously obscured."
Emil recognized the particular clarity that sometimes accompanied advanced ketosis—a kind of crystalline perception that could either represent genuine insight or dangerous delusion. "What connections?"
Felix crossed to Emil's desk, spreading out several pages of notes with unusual urgency. "The Protégé must have specific attributes: medical knowledge, institutional access, connection to the Collector, perhaps..."
He paused, swaying slightly.
"Felix?" Emil rose, medical concern overriding other considerations.
"I'm perfectly—" Felix began, then stopped abruptly as he gripped the edge of the desk. "That was rather unexpected."
Emil moved around the desk, closing the distance between them with unusual haste. "Sit down before you fall."
Felix complied with uncharacteristic docility, sinking into the chair Emil vacated. "How extraordinary," he murmured, his eyes slightly unfocused. "There was a moment of... almost transcendence. As though I were floating above myself."
Emil recognized the description with uncomfortable clarity. "Orthostatic hypotension. Blood pressure drops when rising too quickly, particularly in this state."
"Is that the medical explanation?" Felix asked, his expression suggesting he found the experience more fascinating than concerning. "It felt rather... ecstatic. Briefly."
"A common misconception," Emil replied, falling into the comfortable patterns of medical explanation. "The brain interpreting oxygen deprivation in unusual ways."
Felix looked up at him, eyes suddenly sharp despite their sunken appearance. "Is that what you seek? These moments of altered perception?"
The question struck with unexpected precision. Emil turned away, using the pretext of retrieving water to avoid Felix's penetrating gaze. "It's merely a side effect," he said, his back still turned. "Nothing to be sought or valued."
"Yet you maintain the conditions that produce it," Felix observed quietly. "Day after day."
Emil returned with a glass of water, handing it to Felix without meeting his eyes. "Drink slowly," he instructed, retreating to professional directives in the face of uncomfortable insights.
Felix accepted the water, taking a careful sip. "If I were to continue this regimen," he asked suddenly, "at what point would I be in medical danger?"
The question caught Emil off guard. He studied Felix, making rapid calculations based on his current measurements, visible symptoms, and observed patterns of decline.
"That depends on numerous factors," he hedged, reluctant to provide the specific information.
"Emil." Felix's voice carried unexpected authority despite his weakened state. "As a medical professional. At what point would you intervene if I were your patient?"
Emil sighed, compelled by professional ethics to answer honestly. "Given your starting weight and current rate of decline, intervention would be medically indicated within approximately two to three weeks."
Felix nodded slowly, absorbing this information. Then his gaze sharpened. "And how does your current state compare to this hypothetical future version of me?"
The question hung in the air between them, its implications expanding to fill the room. Emil found himself trapped between professional honesty and personal defense.
"The comparison is invalid," he said finally. "Different baseline measurements, different metabolic factors, different—"
"Different bodies, certainly," Felix interrupted, his usual courtesy temporarily overridden by ketosis-induced directness. "But the same medical principles apply, do they not? The same physiological requirements?"
Emil turned away again, unable to maintain eye contact under Felix's penetrating gaze. "It's not as simple as you suggest."
"Actually," Felix said, rising carefully from the chair, "I suspect it's precisely that simple. My body at your current measurements would be cause for immediate medical intervention. Yet you maintain that your condition is somehow exempt from the very principles you apply to others."
"Things look different on me," Emil protested, the words emerging before he could subject them to his usual scrutiny.
Felix went very still. "Different how?" he asked quietly.
Emil gestured vaguely, uncomfortable with the direction of the conversation. "Physical variations. Individual differences. The visual impression varies significantly between individuals."
"Yet the measurements are objective," Felix pressed. "The numbers don't lie, Emil."
"Numbers cannot capture the complete physical reality," Emil countered, retreating to scientific argument.
Felix moved closer, studying Emil's face with unsettling intensity. "When you look at me," he asked carefully, "what do you see?"
"I see a man who should be attending to his own work rather than interrogating his colleague," Emil replied, attempting to divert the conversation.
"No," Felix insisted, uncharacteristically direct. "Physically. When you look at me, what do you see? Compared to yourself?"
Emil sighed, recognizing that Felix would not be deterred. "I see someone naturally lean," he admitted reluctantly. "Properly proportioned. Aesthetically... correct."
"And when you look at yourself?"
The question penetrated Emil's defenses with unexpected force. He found himself unable to articulate the precise nature of what he saw when he regarded his own reflection—the stubborn persistence of excess despite all evidence to the contrary, the perpetual failure to achieve the perfection his protocol sought.
"I see..." he began, then stopped, struggling to find words that wouldn't expose the fundamental irrationality of his perception. "I see room for improvement," he finished lamely.
Felix's expression shifted, understanding dawning across his features. "Emil," he said softly, "you don't see yourself accurately at all, do you?"
The simple observation, delivered without judgment or accusation, created a fracture in Emil's carefully maintained facade. He turned away, unable to face the gentle insight in Felix's eyes.
"Your perception is distorted," Felix continued quietly. "What you see when you look at me and what you see when you look at yourself—they don't align with objective reality."
"That's absurd," Emil protested, though the words lacked conviction. "I'm a scientist. A physician. I deal in observable facts."
"In all matters except this one," Felix said, his voice gentle but persistent. "The measurements are clear, Emil. Yet you perceive me—demonstrably larger by every objective measure—as somehow smaller than yourself."
Emil found himself without response, the logical contradiction exposed with such clarity that he could no longer maintain his usual rationalizations.
"It's a visual distortion," Felix continued, the realization clearly new to him as well. "A fundamental misperception that no amount of measurement or documentation can correct."
"You're overinterpreting a simple aesthetic judgment," Emil said, but the words sounded hollow even to himself.
Felix shook his head slowly. "No, I don't think so. This explains... so much. Why the protocol never ends. Why no measurement is ever sufficient. You literally cannot see yourself as you are."
The room seemed suddenly too small, the air too thin. Emil moved to the window, needing distance from Felix's penetrating gaze and the uncomfortable truth it contained. Outside, Prague had emerged from the storm washed clean, buildings gleaming in the pale sunlight. The normality of the scene contrasted sharply with the internal upheaval Felix's observation had created.
"The measurements are merely data points," Emil said finally, his back still turned. "Subject to interpretation like any scientific observation."
"Some measurements aren't open to interpretation," Felix replied quietly. "Your current physical state would be cause for immediate medical intervention if observed in a patient. Yet you cannot see it."
The simple, devastating logic of the statement left Emil without response. He continued to stare out the window, seeing not the cityscape before him but the reflection of his own face in the glass—features rendered in transparent overlay upon the solid reality of Prague.
"I wonder," Felix said after a long silence, his voice carrying the slightly disconnected quality characteristic of advanced ketosis, "if the Protégé's interest isn't precisely because of this. He recognizes in you what you cannot see in yourself."
The observation sent a chill through Emil that had nothing to do with his perpetually cold extremities. He turned from the window, finding Felix watching him with an expression of profound concern.
"We need to resume our investigation," Emil said abruptly, desperate to shift focus from the uncomfortable insights Felix had exposed. "The Protégé remains at large, and our current condition renders us increasingly vulnerable."
Felix allowed the change of subject with surprising grace. "Yes," he agreed, moving carefully back to the desk where his notes remained spread. "Though our current state may offer certain advantages in perception, if we can harness this particular clarity without succumbing to its physical costs."
Emil recognized the diplomatic compromise for what it was—an acknowledgment of their shared physical reality without pressing the more uncomfortable personal implications. He joined Felix at the desk, grateful for the return to the external problem of the Protégé rather than the internal contradictions Felix had exposed.
They worked in fits and starts throughout the day, both experiencing the peculiar alternation between intense focus and drifting dissociation characteristic of advanced restriction. Emil found himself watching Felix with new awareness, noting the subtle changes in his movements, the progressive hollowing beneath his cheekbones, the increasingly apparent architecture of bone beneath skin—all while his perception continued to insist that Felix remained properly proportioned while he himself did not.
The contradiction, once explicitly identified, became impossible to ignore completely. Yet Emil found himself unable to fully accept the implications—that his perception itself was fundamentally distorted, that the evidence of his own eyes could not be trusted, that the scientific observer he had prided himself on being was, in this one crucial area, entirely unreliable.
As evening approached, Felix stood at the window, his silhouette outlined against the fading light. "Tomorrow," he said quietly, not turning from his contemplation of the street below, "we must make a decision."
"Regarding?" Emil asked, though he already knew the answer.
"Whether we continue this protocol until neither of us is capable of confronting the Protégé," Felix replied, "or whether we begin to recover our strength for the battle ahead."
The question hung in the air between them, both simple and impossibly complex. Emil found himself without immediate response, caught between the irrefutable logic of Felix's position and the deep, instinctive resistance to abandoning the protocol that had structured his existence for so long.
"We'll discuss it in the morning," he said finally, a delay rather than a resolution.
Felix nodded, not pressing further. The restless energy that had characterized the day began to ebb as evening deepened, replaced by the familiar exhaustion that no amount of rest seemed to alleviate. They retired early, both too drained by the day's physical and emotional demands to maintain their usual evening routines.
In the darkness of his room, Emil lay awake, Felix's observations echoing in his mind with uncomfortable persistence. The possibility that his perception itself was fundamentally distorted—that what he saw when he looked at himself bore no relation to objective reality—was too destabilizing to fully contemplate. Yet the evidence Felix had presented was difficult to dismiss entirely.
Outside, Prague settled into night, the occasional carriage passing on the street below the only interruption to the city's quiet breathing. Emil stared at the ceiling, aware of Felix in the next room, both of them caught in the strange, suspended state between waking and sleeping that advanced restriction produced—a liminal space where thoughts acquired unusual clarity even as the body weakened.
The protocol, which had provided structure and certainty for so long, suddenly seemed less the scientific regimen he had believed it to be and more a prison whose architecture he had designed with meticulous care—a cage built not by the Protégé who watched from without, but by his own hands, constructed bone by careful bone.

The decision never came in the orderly, rational manner Felix had proposed. Instead, on the sixth day, reality intervened with the cold efficiency of physical law.
Emil woke to silence—not the peaceful quiet of early morning, but a weighted absence of sound that immediately registered as wrong. He lay still for a moment, cataloging the sensations of his own body with clinical detachment—the persistent tremor, the hollow spaces between ribs, the slow, measured beat of his heart. Nothing unusual, nothing outside the carefully documented parameters of his protocol.
Yet the silence persisted, heavy and significant.
He rose, moving with the careful precision his condition required, and made his way to Felix's room. The door stood slightly ajar—unusual, given Felix's habitual privacy. Emil hesitated, then pushed it open with deliberate slowness.
The room was dim, curtains still drawn against the morning light. Felix lay on the bed, one arm outstretched, his face turned away. His stillness carried a quality that registered immediately in Emil's medical consciousness, activating professional responses that bypassed his usual measured approach.
"Felix," he said sharply, crossing to the bed with uncharacteristic haste.
No response.
Emil reached for Felix's wrist, fingers automatically finding the pulse point. The rhythm beneath his fingertips was present but thready, too slow, too faint. Felix's skin felt cool to the touch despite the room's moderate temperature.
"Felix," Emil repeated, louder this time, medical urgency overriding propriety as he placed a hand on Felix's shoulder, turning him slightly.
Felix's eyes opened, but the usual sharp intelligence was absent, replaced by a vague, unfocused quality that sent a chill through Emil entirely unrelated to his perpetual coldness.
"Emil?" Felix's voice emerged barely above a whisper, the single word slurring slightly at its edges.
"How long have you been like this?" Emil demanded, professional assessment engaging automatically as he noted the gray pallor beneath Felix's skin, the dry lips, the disorientation in his gaze.
Felix blinked slowly. "Not... certain. Tried to get up earlier... room started spinning."
Emil pressed his palm to Felix's forehead, finding it cool and slightly clammy. "You're developing hypoglycemia," he diagnosed, the medical certainty providing temporary refuge from the emotional implications. "Possibly electrolyte imbalance as well."
Felix's lips curved in a ghost of his usual smile. "Is that... the medical term for... proving my point?"
The hint of Felix's characteristic insight, emerging even through his weakened state, struck Emil with unexpected force. He turned away abruptly, moving to the kitchen with urgent purpose. Medical training provided clear directives—glucose, electrolytes, fluids. He prepared a solution with the precision of a laboratory procedure, measuring sugar and salt with careful hands that refused to acknowledge their own tremor.
When he returned, Felix had managed to push himself to a semi-upright position, though the effort had clearly cost him. Emil held the glass to his lips with the detached efficiency of a physician attending a patient.
"Small sips," he instructed, supporting Felix's head with his free hand. "Too quickly will make it worse."
Felix complied without argument, a concerning indicator in itself. The intimate contact—Emil's fingers against Felix's neck, the careful control required to administer the solution—created a strange doubling effect in Emil's perception. He was simultaneously the clinical physician treating hypoglycemia and the man supporting his closest friend, whose condition existed as devastating indictment of his own protocols.
"This wasn't supposed to happen," Emil said finally, the words emerging with uncharacteristic rawness. "Your physiological response has been accelerated beyond expected parameters."
Felix swallowed carefully before responding, each word requiring visible effort. "Perhaps... I'm simply revealing... the true timeline of your own decline. Without... the years of adaptation."
The observation penetrated Emil's professional detachment with surgical precision. He withdrew slightly, placing the glass on the bedside table.
"Rest," he instructed, falling back on medical directives in the absence of adequate personal response. "I'll prepare something more substantial once this stabilizes your blood sugar."
Felix's hand caught his wrist as he turned to leave, the grip weak but determined. "Emil," he said, his voice slightly stronger now, the solution already beginning its work. "This experiment... is concluded. We have our answer."
Emil looked down at Felix's fingers encircling his wrist—both of them reduced to their essential architecture, bone and tendon outlined beneath skin with anatomical precision. The visual evidence was undeniable, yet his perception insisted on its own distorted truth.
"I need to prepare proper nourishment," Emil said, carefully disengaging from Felix's grasp.
He moved through the apartment with mechanical efficiency, assembling the components of a simple, digestible meal suitable for breaking extended restriction. His medical knowledge provided clear guidelines—small portions, easily assimilated nutrients, careful reintroduction of normal food. His hands performed the necessary tasks with automatic precision while his mind maintained a separate, parallel track of observation and analysis.
Felix's condition represented the inevitable conclusion of the protocol if pursued to its logical end—a destination Emil had been approaching for years with the methodical patience of a researcher following a predetermined experimental design. The evidence lay in the other room, undeniable and damning.
When he returned with a small bowl of thin porridge sweetened with honey, Felix had managed to sit fully upright, though his posture lacked its usual fluid grace.
"Your color is improving," Emil noted, placing the bowl on the bedside table. Medical observation provided safe territory, neutral ground between the personal implications that threatened to overwhelm him.
"The solution helped," Felix acknowledged, his speech clearer now though still bearing the careful, measured quality of someone navigating treacherous terrain. "Though I suspect more substantive intervention is required."
Emil gestured to the porridge. "Small amounts initially. Your digestive system will require time to readjust."
Felix nodded, accepting the bowl with hands that trembled slightly despite his improved condition. Emil watched with clinical detachment as Felix took the first careful spoonful, noting the moment of hesitation, the visible effort required to overcome the body's confusion at this deviation from established pattern.
"You should eat as well," Felix said after several cautious bites.
Emil shook his head slightly. "My attention is better focused on monitoring your recovery."
"Emil." Felix set the spoon down deliberately. "This experiment has provided its conclusion. We both require nourishment to face what comes next."
The simple logic of the statement collided with the deep, instinctive resistance that had become as fundamental to Emil as breathing. He found himself caught in the impossible space between rational understanding and visceral rejection.
"My protocol requires—"
"Your protocol nearly killed me," Felix interrupted, his voice gentle but implacable. "And is doing the same to you, only more slowly."
Emil turned away, unable to maintain eye contact under the weight of Felix's steady gaze. "That was never the intention."
"Intentions matter less than outcomes," Felix replied. "And the outcome is clear. I cannot match your protocol without serious medical consequences. Consequences you yourself are experiencing, however much you've adapted to them."
The room seemed suddenly too small, the air too thin. Emil moved to the window, pulling back the curtains to reveal Prague bathed in morning light. The normality of the scene outside—people moving through their daily patterns, carriages following established routes, the unchanged architecture of the city—contrasted sharply with the fundamental disruption occurring within.
"I need to obtain additional supplies," Emil said finally, a tactical retreat rather than a surrender. "Your recovery will require more substantial nutrition than what's currently available."
Felix studied him for a long moment, clearly recognizing the evasion but choosing not to press further. "Very well," he agreed. "Though I doubt your current condition permits extended excursions."
Emil straightened his shoulders, professional pride asserting itself. "I'm perfectly capable of performing necessary tasks."
He left the room before Felix could respond, using the pretext of changing into street clothes to escape the uncomfortable truth in Felix's gaze. In his room, Emil dressed with mechanical efficiency, avoiding the mirror that would show the dramatic contrast between his current form and the clothing designed for his previous dimensions.
The air outside held the fresh clarity that follows storms, the city washed clean of dust and smoke. Emil moved through the morning streets with careful deliberation, maintaining the precise, measured pace his condition required. Each step represented a complex negotiation between intention and capacity, will overriding the body's increasingly urgent signals of distress.
At the small market near Felix's apartment, Emil selected items with the methodical approach of a researcher assembling experimental materials—bread, eggs, cheese, simple components that could be easily prepared and digested. The transaction completed, he began the return journey, the modest weight of the purchases requiring more effort than he cared to acknowledge.
Halfway back, the world performed a slow, stately rotation around him. Emil stopped, placing one hand against a building facade to maintain his balance. The stone felt cool beneath his palm, its solid reality contrasting with the increasing insubstantiality of his own physical presence.
"Professor Králik? Are you unwell?"
The voice came from somewhere to his left. Emil turned carefully, finding a vaguely familiar face regarding him with concern—a student, perhaps, or a junior colleague. The specific identity remained frustratingly elusive.
"Perfectly well," Emil replied, straightening with deliberate effort. "A momentary pause for observation."
The concern in the other man's expression suggested the pretense was less convincing than Emil intended, but social convention prevented further inquiry. With a nod that contained both respect and doubt, the man continued on his way.
Emil resumed his journey with renewed determination, each step a conscious act of will. By the time he reached Felix's building, his vision had acquired a peculiar tunneling effect, peripheral awareness fading as he concentrated on the immediate task of ascending the stairs.
He found Felix in the kitchen, dressed but moving with the careful deliberation of someone navigating an unfamiliar physical reality. Felix looked up as Emil entered, his expression shifting from concentration to concern.
"You look unwell," Felix observed, taking the market basket from Emil's unresisting hands.
"The excursion was perhaps more taxing than anticipated," Emil conceded, allowing himself to sink into a chair with uncharacteristic lack of composure.
Felix busied himself unpacking the purchases, his movements slow but purposeful. "You purchased actual food," he noted, a hint of his usual dry humor briefly visible beneath the physical exhaustion. "I confess I half-expected you to return with more broth and toast."
Emil did not respond, concentrating on regulating his breathing, on managing the persistent lightness in his head, on maintaining his seated position through force of will.
"I'm going to prepare eggs," Felix announced, his tone suggesting this was not merely a statement of intent but a declaration of changed circumstances. "For both of us."
Emil opened his mouth to object, to reiterate the requirements of his protocol, to explain the scientific necessity of his regimen—but found the words refused to materialize. The evidence stood before him, moving with careful deliberation around the kitchen: Felix, reduced to a shadow of his usual robust presence by merely five days of Emil's "protocol."
The implication was unavoidable, however much Emil's mind sought to evade it. If five days had created such dramatic effects in Felix, what had years done to him?
Felix worked in silence, his usual fluid grace replaced by the measured movements of someone navigating significant physical weakness. The simple task of preparing eggs required visible concentration, each action deliberate and carefully executed.
When he placed a plate before Emil some minutes later, the two eggs appeared as a challenge more daunting than any academic dispute or professional confrontation Emil had faced.
"A reasonable portion for reintroduction," Felix observed, seating himself across from Emil with his own plate. "Medically sound, by your own expertise."
Emil stared at the food before him, experiencing the familiar tightening in his chest, the visceral resistance that had become as fundamental as breathing. The protocol, which had provided structure and certainty for so long, stood in direct opposition to the irrefutable evidence Felix had provided through his own body.
"This is necessary," Felix said quietly, correctly interpreting Emil's hesitation. "Not merely for recovery, but for survival. The Protégé remains a threat, and in our current condition, we are defenseless against whatever he intends."
The invocation of the external threat provided unexpected leverage against Emil's internal resistance. Professional pride, which had sustained his protocol for so long, now suggested an opposing course—the necessity of physical capability to confront the danger the Protégé represented.
With deliberate motion, Emil picked up his fork. The first bite required more courage than he cared to acknowledge, the simple act of consuming actual nourishment representing a fundamental breach of the protocol that had governed his existence for years.
Felix made no comment, focusing on his own careful consumption. They ate in silence, each navigating the complicated terrain of reintroduction—the body's simultaneous hunger and resistance, the strange rediscovery of flavor and substance after prolonged restriction.
"A beginning," Felix said finally, when both plates held only remnants. "Small but significant."
Emil nodded, unable to articulate the complex mixture of relief and terror the simple meal had produced—relief at the energy already beginning to flow back into his system, terror at the breach of protocol, at the loss of control, at the uncertain territory ahead.
"We should rest," he said instead, falling back on medical recommendation. "The initial phase of refeeding requires careful management of energy expenditure."
Felix nodded, rising with the careful deliberation that had characterized his movements since his morning collapse. "Though our investigation cannot pause for long. The Protégé will not wait for our recovery."
The reminder of external threat provided unexpected structure, a framework to replace the protocol that had been irrevocably breached. Emil found himself clinging to this new organizing principle—the necessity of regaining strength to confront the danger that stalked them both.
They retired to separate rooms, though Emil found rest elusive despite his physical exhaustion. His body, accustomed to the clarity that prolonged restriction produced, responded to even this modest nourishment with confusion—energy returning in unpredictable surges, thoughts racing then slowing, the familiar patterns of his internal landscape fundamentally disrupted.
He lay awake, staring at the ceiling, aware of Felix in the next room, both of them navigating the strange territory between their previous state and whatever would follow. The protocol, breached now beyond repair, offered no guidance for this uncharted terrain.
Outside, Prague continued its daily patterns, unaware of the fundamental disruption occurring within the apartment's walls. Inside, Emil confronted the terrifying possibility that the scientific observer he had prided himself on being was, in this one crucial area, entirely unreliable—that years of meticulous documentation had recorded not objective reality but the progression of a profound perceptual distortion.
The realization offered no comfort, no clear path forward, only the disorienting recognition that the map he had followed with such precision may have been fundamentally flawed from the beginning.

By afternoon, the modest breakfast Emil had managed to consume had become a weight in his stomach, a foreign presence his body regarded with increasing suspicion. He sat at Felix's desk, attempting to focus on their notes regarding the Protégé, but found his attention repeatedly drawn to the growing discomfort in his abdomen.
Felix had retired again after their meal, his body demanding additional rest to process even that small amount of nourishment. Emil listened to the quiet breathing from the other room, confirming Felix's continued sleep before rising with careful deliberation.
In the small bathroom, Emil knelt on the tiled floor, his body taking matters into its own hands with ruthless efficiency. The sickness came in waves, his stomach rejecting the intrusion of actual nourishment after years of cultivated emptiness. He vomited with the quiet precision of someone well-practiced in the art of discretion, one hand pressed against his mouth to muffle any sound that might alert Felix.
When it was over, he rinsed his mouth and splashed cold water on his face, studying his reflection in the small mirror with clinical detachment. The shadowed eyes, the hollow cheeks, the sharp angles of bone beneath skin—all registered with the strange double vision Felix's observations had created. He saw simultaneously the physical structure he had carefully cultivated and, fleetingly, glimpses of what Felix must see when looking at him.
He returned to the main room, moving with careful quietness to avoid disturbing Felix's rest. The apartment held the particular stillness of afternoon, muted light filtering through curtains, the occasional sounds from the street below only emphasizing the quiet within.
Some hours later, Felix emerged from his room, moving with the careful deliberation that had characterized his actions since morning. His appearance had changed subtly—still gaunt, still hollow-eyed, but with a certain alertness returned to his gaze.
"You look worse," Felix observed, studying Emil with the same penetrating attention he typically applied to architectural details.
"The paradox of initial refeeding," Emil explained, falling into the comfortable patterns of medical exposition. "The body, accustomed to restriction, responds to nourishment with confusion. Energy is diverted to digestive processes, creating temporary weakness before improvement begins."
Felix nodded slowly, accepting the explanation without comment on its conspicuous applicability to Emil's current state. "Then we should continue the process," he said instead. "Regular, small amounts until stability returns."
Emil felt the familiar tightening in his chest, the visceral resistance that had become fundamental. "Perhaps later," he hedged. "The initial introduction should be fully processed before—"
"Emil." Felix's interruption carried unexpected authority despite his weakened state. "I understand the caution required, but we've moved beyond medical prudence into deliberate avoidance."
"I'm applying established medical principles for refeeding after prolonged restriction," Emil countered, retreating to professional territory.
"Then apply them properly," Felix replied, moving to the kitchen with clear purpose. "What would you recommend for a patient in our condition at this stage? Surely not continued fasting."
Emil followed, drawn by both concern for Felix's still-precarious condition and instinctive resistance to what he knew would follow. "Something extremely light," he conceded. "Diluted broth, perhaps, or—"
"Lighter than this morning?" Felix asked, turning to face him with a hint of his usual wry humor. "Shall we subsist on air, Emil? A particularly nutritious variety of nothing?"
The gentle mockery contained enough truth to penetrate Emil's defenses. He watched in silence as Felix began assembling materials for another simple meal—bread, cheese, elements that would have been utterly commonplace before but now represented a profound disruption to the protocol that had governed his existence.
As Felix worked, Emil found himself increasingly unable to maintain his usual stillness. He began to pace the small kitchen, movements sharp and agitated, hands alternately clenched at his sides or running through his hair in uncharacteristic displays of anxiety.
Felix observed this with quiet attention, his own movements deliberately calm in contrast. "You look," he noted finally, "like a man who wishes to crawl out of his own skin."
Emil stopped abruptly, the observation striking with uncomfortable precision. "I very much would like to do so," he snapped, the words emerging with uncharacteristic rawness.
Felix set down the knife he had been using, turning to face Emil directly. Without comment, he extended his hand, the gesture containing neither demand nor pressure, merely invitation.
Emil stared at the offered hand, experiencing the strange doubling effect that had characterized his perception since Felix's collapse—seeing simultaneously the physical reality before him and the complex emotional architecture beneath it.
"Come," Felix said quietly. "We both need rest more than food at this moment."
Emil found himself accepting Felix's hand, the simple contact—skin against skin, warmth against perpetual cold—registering with startling clarity. He allowed Felix to lead him from the kitchen, both of them moving with the careful deliberation their weakened condition required.
They ended up in Felix's room, collapsing onto the bed with the ungraceful exhaustion of survivors. Emil found himself lying beside Felix, both of them still fully dressed, staring at the ceiling in the diffuse afternoon light.
"This is terribly disreputable," Emil observed, the absurdity of the comment striking him even as he spoke.
Felix laughed, the sound carrying a shadow of his usual warmth despite its weakness. "In contrast to what the previous week has looked like?" he asked. "I believe propriety has already fled the premises, Emil."
The observation contained enough truth to penetrate Emil's usual reserve. He found himself smiling slightly, the expression unfamiliar on features that had maintained professional seriousness for so long.
They lay in silence, side by side in the narrow bed, close enough that Emil could feel the slight warmth radiating from Felix's body. The strangeness of the situation—both of them weakened, defenses lowered by hunger and fatigue and recent revelations—created an intimacy unlike anything Emil had experienced.
Without conscious decision, he found himself relaxing into the moment, the perpetual vigilance that had characterized his existence briefly suspended. Felix's breathing had slowed beside him, suggesting he had drifted back to sleep. Emil allowed his own eyes to close, surrendering to the exhaustion that never fully receded regardless of rest.
He woke some time later to rising nausea, the familiar sensation climbing his throat with insistent urgency. Extracting himself carefully from the bed to avoid disturbing Felix, Emil made his way to the bathroom with urgent purpose.
The sickness came in waves, more violent than before despite having less to expel. He knelt on the tiled floor, body locked in its reflexive rejection, throat burning with the effort. When it finally subsided, he remained kneeling, forehead pressed against the cool porcelain, body trembling with the aftermath.
Upon returning to Felix's room, he found his friend still apparently asleep, breathing deep and even in the fading afternoon light. Emil hesitated, then slipped back onto the bed, drawn by the promise of warmth. His body had begun to shake, alternating waves of heat and cold washing through him in the aftermath of sickness.
He positioned himself close to Felix, seeking heat without direct contact, maintaining the minimum distance propriety demanded even in these extraordinary circumstances. The shaking gradually subsided as Felix's proximity provided the warmth Emil's body could no longer generate for itself.
He must have drifted back to sleep, for he woke to Felix's voice, surprisingly close to his ear.
"Emil," Felix said softly, the word carrying a plaintive note entirely uncharacteristic of his usual composure. "I find myself rather desperately hungry."
Emil opened his eyes to find Felix watching him with an expression that combined genuine discomfort with a hint of deliberate vulnerability—a strategic deployment of weakness.
"You are not a child requesting a bedtime sweet," Emil replied, though the reprimand lacked its usual force.
"No," Felix agreed, "merely a grown man requesting that his friend, who happens to be a physician, assist him in not starving to death on principle."
The direct attack, delivered with Felix's characteristic precision despite his weakened state, left Emil without adequate defense. He sighed, extracting himself from the bed with careful movements that respected his body's fragility.
"I will prepare something suitable," he conceded, reluctant respect for Felix's tactical approach evident in his tone.
In the kitchen, Emil selected with deliberate care—a small apple, sliced thinly; a piece of bread; a fragment of cheese. All items his research indicated would be least likely to provoke his body's violent rejection, presented in portions that acknowledged their current limitations while making visible concession to Felix's expressed hunger.
When he returned with the modest offerings arranged on a plate, Felix raised an eyebrow at both content and quantity but made no comment. He accepted the food with simple gratitude, consuming each piece with careful deliberation, clearly navigating the complicated terrain between hunger and his body's confusion at this disruption of established patterns.
Emil watched, making clinical observations regarding Felix's color, the steadiness of his hands, the signs of energy gradually returning to his system. The medical assessment provided safe territory, neutral ground between the personal implications that threatened to overwhelm him.
As evening approached, they moved through the apartment with the synchronicity of longtime companions, preparing for night with unspoken coordination. Emil returned to his own room briefly, gathering the materials necessary for his evening documentation—though the protocol had been breached, certain habits remained too ingrained to abandon entirely.
He was just completing his notes when Felix appeared in the doorway.
"I have one more question regarding our investigation," Felix said, his tone suggesting this was a matter of some importance. "If you wouldn't mind discussing it before we retire."
Emil nodded, following Felix back to his room with the unsuspecting compliance of a man who has not yet recognized a tactical deployment. It was only when Felix gestured toward the bed, clearly indicating they should continue their earlier repose, that Emil realized the pretense.
"Your question?" he prompted, seating himself on the edge of the bed with deliberate formality.
"Will wait until morning," Felix replied, the hint of a smile visible despite his exhaustion. "We both require rest to process properly."
Emil recognized the manipulation but found himself lacking the energy to resist. The events of the day—the sickness, the confrontation, the tentative steps toward nourishment—had depleted his already limited reserves. He allowed himself to lie down beside Felix, maintaining a careful distance that Felix neither commented on nor challenged.
They lay in silence, side by side in the narrow bed, close enough for awareness but not for touch. Emil listened as Felix's breathing gradually slowed and deepened, indicating he had drifted into sleep. He waited longer, ensuring the unconsciousness was genuine, before carefully extracting himself from the bed.
In the bathroom, Emil knelt on the tiled floor for the third time that day, but now with deliberate intent rather than involuntary reflex. The fruit and bread Felix had consumed without incident represented a threat his body could not tolerate, a disruption to the protocol that had governed his existence for years.
He induced vomiting with the quiet efficiency of long practice, fingers pressed against the back of his throat, body responding with mechanical obedience to this familiar command. The process completed, he rinsed his mouth and studied his reflection in the small mirror with clinical detachment.
A thought occurred to him as he performed this routine assessment—why had he persisted in this behavior when, unlike earlier episodes, his body had not actually rejected the food independently? The question arose with scientific curiosity, researcher observing subject with professional interest. He had acted automatically, the behavior so deeply ingrained it required no conscious decision.
The observation created a momentary distance between actor and action, a brief recognition of pattern rather than necessity. Emil filed this insight away for later consideration, attention drawn to more immediate physical concerns as weakness washed through him in the aftermath of purging.
He made his way back to Felix's room with careful deliberation, each step requiring specific focus. The familiar alternation of hot and cold had returned, his body's confused response to the cycle of nourishment and deprivation. He slipped back onto the bed, drawn by the promise of warmth, positioning himself close to Felix's still form.
"I had hoped," Felix said quietly into the darkness, his voice startling in the silence, "that by having you select and prepare the evening meal, this would not happen again."
The simple statement, delivered without accusation or judgment, created a fracture in Emil's carefully maintained facade. He realized with a start that Felix had not only been awake during his absence but had been aware of his earlier episodes as well.
"You were asleep," Emil said, the protest sounding hollow even to himself.
"I was resting," Felix corrected gently. "There is a distinction."
Emil turned away, unable to face Felix even in the darkness. "The body requires time to adjust," he said, falling back on medical explanation. "Reintroduction must proceed gradually."
"Indeed," Felix agreed, his voice carrying no hint of judgment despite the circumstances. "Though voluntary removal after introduction somewhat conflicts with the process."
The simple observation, delivered with Felix's characteristic precision, left Emil without adequate response. He lay in silence, aware of Felix beside him, both of them navigating the complicated terrain between illness and recovery, truth and deception, pattern and disruption.
"We'll try again tomorrow," Felix said finally, the words containing neither condemnation nor absolution, merely statement of fact. "And perhaps the day after, and the day after that. Until the pattern changes."
Emil made no response, unable to offer either confirmation or denial in the face of such gentle persistence. Outside, Prague had settled into night, the occasional carriage passing on the street below the only interruption to the city's quiet breathing. Inside, the protocol lay shattered around him, yet its ghost remained, haunting his actions with the persistence of habit too deeply ingrained to easily abandon.
"Try to sleep," Felix said softly. "Morning can be a fresh beginning."
The simple suggestion contained more optimism than Emil could currently access, yet he found some comfort in Felix's continued faith despite the evidence of the day. He closed his eyes, surrendering to the exhaustion that never fully receded regardless of rest.
Beside him, Felix's breathing gradually slowed and deepened, genuine sleep replacing the earlier pretense. Emil remained awake, staring into the darkness, aware of his body's continued betrayal—the weakness, the tremor, the hollow spaces between his ribs—with unusual clarity.
The Protégé, who watched from without, suddenly seemed less threatening than the patterns that governed from within—patterns recorded with scientific precision in the leather-bound notebook, documented with the methodical care of a researcher observing a progressive condition. Patterns that, Felix had suggested with such gentle insight, might represent not scientific protocol but something far more dangerous—a fundamental distortion of perception that rendered Emil unreliable in the one area he had believed himself most rigorous.
The recognition offered no comfort, no clear path forward, only the disorienting awareness that the structure he had followed with such precision may have been destroying rather than sustaining him all along.

The next morning brought a peculiar heaviness to them both, as though the weight removed from their bodies had been redistributed to their movements. Emil woke to find himself still in Felix's bed, their positions having shifted during the night to an unconscious proximity that propriety would never have permitted in waking hours.
He extracted himself carefully, moving with the deliberate precision his condition required. Felix stirred but didn't wake, his face in repose showing with painful clarity the changes of the past week—the hollowed cheeks, the sharpened jawline, the fragility that had replaced his usual robust presence.
Emil completed his morning documentation with clinical detachment, recording the figures in his leather-bound notebook with scientific precision. The measurements showed continued decline despite yesterday's tentative attempts at nourishment, the pattern of reduction maintaining its inexorable progression.
When Felix finally emerged some hours later, he moved with the careful deliberation of an invalid, each step requiring specific consideration.
"This must be semester pause," Felix observed, lowering himself into a chair with uncharacteristic caution. "I can't recall the last time we've had so many consecutive days without professional obligations."
Emil nodded, grateful for the reminder of time's passage. The days of their shared experiment had acquired a strange, suspended quality, disconnected from normal rhythms. "The university calendar provides fortunate timing," he agreed. "Though we should resume our investigation of the Protégé as soon as our condition permits."
Felix smiled faintly. "That's the question, isn't it? What exactly constitutes 'permitting' in our current state." He stretched his arms experimentally, wincing slightly. "I find myself missing yesterday's restless energy. That strange clarity of ketosis, even the swooning euphoria. Terrible as it was."
Emil looked at him sharply, medical concern engaging automatically. "That represents dangerous metabolic disruption, not a desirable state."
"I know," Felix said, raising a hand in apology. "Forgive me. Though I'm not entirely joking." He gestured vaguely toward his own body. "This in-between state—neither properly fed nor experiencing the paradoxical energy of advanced restriction—seems the worst of both worlds."
Emil frowned, medical assessment engaging as he studied Felix with professional attention. "Allow me to check your condition," he said, the request phrased as gentle command.
Felix submitted without protest, extending his wrist for Emil's examination. The pulse beneath Emil's fingertips registered as thready but present, the rhythm slightly slower than optimal but within acceptable parameters. More concerning was the continued prominence of bone beneath skin, the visible architecture that documented their shared decline.
"You're still losing weight," Emil observed, medical concern momentarily overriding his usual reserve.
"As are you," Felix countered softly.
Emil stepped back, withdrawing both physically and emotionally from the uncomfortable observation. He began to pace the small sitting room, hands clasped behind his back then moving to adjust his collar, to smooth his hair, to perform the small, restless gestures that betrayed his internal agitation.
"I can't—" he began, then stopped abruptly, the admission threatening to expose vulnerabilities he had maintained with careful precision for years.
"Can't what, Emil?" Felix asked, his voice gentle but persistent.
Emil continued his pacing, movements sharp and disconnected. "I can't procure what you require," he said finally, the words emerging with painful effort. "I can't—I can't consume what would be necessary to demonstrate proper recovery protocols."
His hands moved in uncharacteristic gestures, alternately clenched at his sides or rubbing his arms as though perpetually cold. "I can't maintain the protocol that sustained me, yet I can't abandon it either. I find myself in an impossible position."
Felix watched this display with quiet attention, allowing Emil's agitation to express itself without interruption. When Emil finally paused, breathing more rapidly than his minimal exertion warranted, Felix spoke with careful deliberation.
"We are in holiday," he said, his tone suggesting he was offering a gift rather than making an observation. "We are in our rooms, with very little chance of anyone forcibly carrying us off. It can take the time it takes, Emil."
The simple permission—to proceed at a pace that respected the depth of Emil's patterns rather than demanding immediate transformation—created a momentary stillness in Emil's restless movements. He studied Felix's face, searching for signs of manipulation or judgment, finding only quiet acceptance.
"You require proper nourishment," Emil insisted, medical concern providing safer territory than personal vulnerability. "Your measurements indicate continued decline."
"As do yours," Felix replied softly. "Yet here we both remain, functioning despite medical predictions to the contrary."
He rose carefully, moving to his drafting table with deliberate steps. "Perhaps we might focus on our investigation for now. The Protégé remains at large, and our current physical limitations don't prevent intellectual progress."
The suggestion offered unexpected reprieve—a return to the work that had provided structure and purpose before their experiment had disrupted everything. Emil found himself nodding, grateful for the redirection from impossible personal terrain to the more navigable ground of professional inquiry.
They settled into their respective tasks—Emil at the small desk, Felix at his drafting table—with the synchronicity of longtime companions. The familiar rhythm of shared work provided temporary refuge from the complicated realities of their physical condition, allowing them to focus outward rather than inward.
As the day progressed, Emil noticed a subtle shift in Felix's approach. Where previously Felix had interrupted their work regularly to prepare modest meals or to remind Emil of the need for nourishment, now he remained absorbed in their investigation, making no mention of food or physical needs.
By evening, they had consumed nothing but tea and water, their shared focus on the Protégé's possible identity and methods having displaced attention to their bodies' requirements. Emil found himself simultaneously relieved at the absence of pressure and vaguely concerned by the implications of this change in pattern.
"You've stopped," he observed as they prepared for sleep, the observation emerging before he could subject it to his usual scrutiny.
Felix looked up, his expression questioning. "Stopped?"
"Attempting to enforce nourishment," Emil clarified, discomfort with the subject evident in his careful phrasing.
Felix's expression revealed nothing as he considered his response. "I've recognized that certain approaches are counterproductive," he said finally. "And that progress may require different strategies than I initially employed."
Emil studied him with the careful attention he typically applied to research subjects, sensing something withheld in Felix's measured response. But exhaustion and the relief of reprieve combined to prevent deeper inquiry. He nodded, accepting the explanation without further questioning.
They retired to separate rooms that night, the unusual intimacy of their previous shared sleep apparently concluded by mutual, unspoken agreement. Emil lay awake in his own bed, aware of Felix's presence in the next room, both of them navigating the complicated terrain between illness and recovery, pattern and disruption, truth and self-deception.
The days that followed established a new rhythm, different from both Emil's original protocol and their brief experiment with refeeding. They consumed minimal nourishment—tea, occasional broth, fragments of bread—just enough to maintain basic function without triggering Emil's reflexive purging. Felix no longer pressed for more substantial intake, seeming to accept their current state as temporary compromise.
Their investigation progressed with the peculiar clarity that advanced restriction sometimes produced—a crystalline focus that could either represent genuine insight or dangerous delusion. They constructed elaborate theories regarding the Protégé's identity and methods, mapping possible connections between the Collector's network and current medical institutions.
Emil found himself gradually relaxing into this new pattern, the pressure of Felix's previous insistence on proper nourishment replaced by their shared immersion in intellectual work. The physical consequences of their continued restriction remained present—weakness, cold, tremor—but receded from immediate attention as they focused outward rather than inward.
What Emil failed to notice, or perhaps chose not to acknowledge, was the gradual intensification of these symptoms in them both. The measurements he continued to record with scientific precision documented their continued decline, the numbers dropping with steady persistence despite having stabilized their minimal intake.
It was on the twelfth day since Felix had begun matching his protocol—two days before the point Emil had calculated would require medical intervention—that the accumulated consequences made themselves impossible to ignore.
They were in the sitting room, reviewing their notes on the Protégé's possible connection to several medical institutions, when Emil rose to retrieve a specific document from his papers. The movement, performed with his usual careful deliberation, was accompanied by an unexpected darkening of his vision, a tunneling effect that had become increasingly frequent but which he had attributed to standing too quickly.
This time, however, the darkness didn't recede. Emil was vaguely aware of the room tilting at an impossible angle, of Felix's voice calling his name from a great distance, of the floor rising to meet him with surprising gentleness.
He regained awareness in gradual layers—first the sensation of being horizontal rather than vertical, then the weight of something covering him, then the texture of carpet beneath him rather than the bed he had expected. Opening his eyes required specific concentration, each lid seemingly weighted with lead.
Felix's face swam into focus above him, features sharp with concern in the lamplight. Emil became aware that they were both on the floor of the sitting room, wrapped in what appeared to be a blanket Felix had somehow managed to procure during his unconsciousness.
"Welcome back," Felix said, his attempt at light tone undermined by the genuine worry evident in his expression.
Emil tried to sit up, finding the movement beyond his current capabilities. "How long?" he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.
"Only a few minutes," Felix replied. "Though I confess they felt considerably longer from my perspective."
Emil noted with professional detachment that Felix had positioned himself to provide warmth, their bodies pressed together beneath the blanket in a proximity that would have been unthinkable under normal circumstances. More concerning was Felix's obvious weakness—the effort it had clearly cost him to manage even this modest intervention, the tremor visible in his hands despite his attempts to conceal it.
"I miscalculated," Emil said, the admission torn from somewhere beneath his usual scientific precision.
Felix's expression softened. "We both did," he replied, his voice carrying unexpected rawness. "I owe you an apology, Emil."
Emil looked at him with confusion, unable to understand what Felix could possibly feel apologetic for in their current circumstances.
"I stopped encouraging proper nourishment," Felix continued, his voice low with confession. "I thought—foolishly, I now recognize—that by removing the pressure to eat, I could spare you the need to purge. That we could maintain a minimal intake without triggering that response while gradually improving."
He looked away, unable to maintain eye contact. "I also thought I might access again that state of mind I experienced briefly—that strange clarity and energy. I convinced myself it might aid our investigation."
Felix shook his head slightly, self-recrimination evident in every line of his face. "It was... incredibly foolish. Dangerously so. I allowed my own fascination with the experience to override medical sense."
Emil stared at him, momentarily rendered speechless by this unexpected revelation. When he finally found his voice, the words emerged with uncharacteristic sharpness. "You deliberately encouraged continued restriction? After witnessing its effects? After experiencing them yourself? After everything you said about the damage it causes?"
The professional outrage provided temporary strength, allowing Emil to push himself to a seated position despite his weakness. "You do understand we are approaching the threshold I calculated for medical intervention? That your current measurements indicate dangerous depletion of essential reserves?"
Felix remained silent under this barrage, accepting the rebuke without defense. When Emil's accusations finally exhausted themselves, he spoke with quiet humility.
"I deserved that," he said simply. "It is certainly one of the more foolish things I've done."
He trailed off, his gaze caught by something across the room. Emil followed his line of sight, finding they were both reflected in the mirror on the opposite wall—two figures huddled beneath a blanket, reduced to the essential architecture of bone beneath skin, rendered in the same pale palette of deprivation.
Felix turned his head slightly, the movement casting shadows below his cheekbones, emphasizing the hollow spaces where fullness had once resided. Emil found himself mesmerized by the image, seeing simultaneously the objective evidence of their condition and the strange, compelling beauty his distorted perception insisted upon.
"This..." Felix said quietly, still studying their reflection. "This is what you like, though, isn't it?"
He looked down at his hands, the bones standing out in his fingers and wrists with anatomical precision. "This is what you find attractive, isn't it?" he asked, his voice resigned, quiet.
"Of course," Emil answered automatically, thinking Felix meant in himself, the ideal toward which his protocol had been directed for so long. The physical perfection his measurements documented but his eyes could never quite confirm.
"And yet even this is not enough to make you want me as I want you."
The simple statement, delivered with quiet certainty, created a fracture in Emil's understanding of their entire relationship. He stared at Felix, unable to process the implications of his words.
"I—I don't understand," Emil stammered, genuinely confused. "You mean... in yourself? That's what someone would find attractive? That I seek to emulate?"
Felix turned to look at him directly, brow furrowed in sudden comprehension. "No, Emil," he clarified gently. "I meant in me. That this—" he gestured toward his own hollowed form, "—might finally make me physically appealing to you. In the way you have always been to me."
Emil went very still beneath the quilt they shared, feeling Felix's heart beating against his own body through the layers of clothing that separated them. The proximity, which medical necessity had justified, suddenly acquired an entirely different significance.
"You..." Emil began, then stopped, unable to formulate a coherent response to this revelation. "You find me... You want..."
Felix smiled faintly, the expression containing equal parts affection and sadness. "For years, Emil. Though I had hoped it might be evident without requiring explicit declaration, particularly given recent circumstances."
Emil's mind raced, reviewing their interactions through this new lens—Felix's careful attention, his genuine concern, his willingness to match Emil's destructive patterns rather than abandon him to them, his acceptance of Emil's peculiarities without judgment.
"I thought..." Emil said carefully, each word requiring specific consideration, "that you were merely being kind. That your natural sociability extended to everyone. That your concern was professional, or at most, friendly."
Felix shook his head slightly, the movement causing shadows to shift across his hollowed features. "My concern is genuine," he said quietly. "As is my regard for you as colleague and friend. But there has always been more, Emil. Though I've been careful not to press what I assumed was unwelcome."
Emil found himself without adequate response, caught between the shock of this revelation and the more immediate physical realities of their condition. The room seemed suddenly too small, the air too thin, yet he lacked the strength to create distance between them.
"I've upset you," Felix observed, his perception acute despite his weakened state. "That wasn't my intention."

Here we have two options

## Option 1:
"No," Emil replied quickly, the denial emerging before he could subject it to his usual scrutiny. "Not upset. Merely... recalibrating."
The scientific term provided momentary refuge, a framework to process this fundamental shift in understanding. Emil found himself acutely aware of their physical proximity, of the weight of Felix's revelation, of the complicated intersection between their current condition and this unexpected declaration.
"We should focus on recovery," Emil said finally, professional concern providing safer territory than emotional response. "Your condition—our condition—requires immediate attention."
Felix studied him for a long moment, clearly recognizing the deflection but choosing not to press further. "Yes," he agreed finally. "Though I suspect true recovery will require addressing more than merely physical depletion."
The observation contained layers Emil wasn't currently equipped to fully process. He nodded, accepting the truth without engaging its deeper implications.
"Can you stand?" he asked instead, medical assessment engaging automatically.
"With assistance," Felix replied, his usual pride temporarily set aside in acknowledgment of their shared vulnerability.
They managed to rise together, each supporting the other in a careful choreography of weakness assisting weakness. The short distance to Felix's bedroom required their complete concentration, each step a deliberate negotiation between intention and capacity.
By the time they reached the bed, both were breathing rapidly from the minimal exertion, faces pale with the effort required. They collapsed onto the mattress with ungraceful exhaustion, still wrapped in the blanket Felix had somehow managed to procure during Emil's unconsciousness.
"We will begin proper refeeding tomorrow," Emil said, the words emerging as both promise and threat—commitment to recovery and acknowledgment of the difficult terrain ahead.
Felix nodded, not pressing for further discussion of his revelation or Emil's response to it. The physical demands of their condition temporarily overshadowed the emotional complexities revealed in the sitting room.
They lay side by side in silence, both too exhausted for further conversation yet too alert for sleep. Outside, Prague continued its evening patterns, unaware of the fundamental disruptions occurring within the apartment's walls. Inside, Emil confronted not only the physical consequences of his protocol but the emotional terrain Felix's revelation had exposed—territory more uncharted and dangerous than any medical crisis.
The protocol, which had provided structure and certainty for so long, lay shattered beyond repair. In its place, something far more complex and terrifying was emerging—a landscape without the clear measurements and documented patterns that had governed his existence for years.

## Option 2:

As their breathing gradually slowed, the room settling into the peculiar stillness of early evening, Felix broke the silence with careful deliberation.
"I've made you uncomfortable," he observed, his voice carrying the precise modulation of someone measuring each word. "That wasn't my intention."
Emil remained motionless, staring at the ceiling, acutely aware of Felix beside him yet unable to bridge the new complexity between them. "No," he said finally, the denial automatic rather than considered.
"You needn't be kind, Emil," Felix replied, a hint of his usual wry humor briefly visible beneath the exhaustion. "I can recognize when I've miscalculated."
He shifted slightly, creating a deliberate distance between them despite the narrow confines of the bed. "I should not have spoken," he continued, his tone neutral in a way that suggested careful control rather than genuine detachment. "Particularly not under our current circumstances."
Emil turned his head slightly, studying Felix's profile in the fading light. The sharp angles, the hollow spaces, the architectural precision of bone beneath skin—all registered with the strange double vision that had characterized his perception since their experiment began.
"You presume to know my thoughts," Emil said finally, the observation emerging with uncharacteristic directness.
Felix continued to stare at the ceiling. "I presume nothing," he replied quietly. "I merely observe your response."
"My response," Emil repeated slowly, "has been primarily focused on our immediate physical crisis rather than processing your... revelation."
Felix smiled faintly, though the expression contained more resignation than humor. "A convenient prioritization," he observed, "though not without medical justification."
He turned his head finally, meeting Emil's gaze with the direct attention that had always characterized their interactions. "Let me spare you further discomfort," he said, his voice gentle but resolute. "What I expressed was merely an observation about my own regard, not an expectation requiring response. It changes nothing about our friendship or professional relationship."
The careful precision of this statement, its deliberate creation of distance and release from obligation, struck Emil with unexpected force. He recognized the familiar pattern of Felix offering refuge, creating space for retreat, prioritizing Emil's comfort above his own desires.
"You're doing it again," Emil observed, the insight emerging before he could subject it to his usual scrutiny.
Felix's expression shifted to genuine confusion. "Doing what?"
"Providing escape routes," Emil replied, surprising himself with the clarity of the observation. "Creating distance when closeness becomes uncomfortable. Assuming rejection before it's offered."
Felix looked away, unable to maintain eye contact under the precision of Emil's unexpected insight. "It seemed the kindest approach," he said finally, his voice barely above a whisper. "For both of us."
Emil found himself in unfamiliar territory—not the precisely mapped landscape of his protocol, with its documented measurements and calculated patterns, but something far less charted. He felt a strange doubling effect in his perception, seeing simultaneously the physical reality beside him and the complex emotional architecture their relationship had contained all along.
"I have spent years," Emil said carefully, each word requiring specific consideration, "interpreting your actions through a particular lens. Your attention as professional interest. Your concern as collegial regard. Your physical proximity as casual sociability."
He paused, the effort of extended speech taxing his limited reserves. "I have been... recalibrating that interpretation in light of recent events. But I require time to process fully."
Felix nodded, accepting this measured response without pressing for greater clarity. "Of course," he said quietly. "And I assure you, regardless of that processing, our friendship remains unchanged. I would never presume to—"
"Felix," Emil interrupted, the uncharacteristic directness halting Felix mid-sentence. "I am not rejecting anything. I am merely... assessing."
The simple statement, delivered with scientific precision rather than emotional reassurance, seemed to affect Felix more deeply than any conventional comfort might have. He studied Emil's face with careful attention, searching for confirmation of what he had heard.
"I see," he said finally, the two simple words containing volumes of restrained response.
They lay in silence after that, side by side in the narrow bed, close enough for awareness but respecting the complex territory between them. The physical demands of their condition temporarily overshadowed the emotional revelations, exhaustion eventually pulling them both toward sleep despite the unresolved conversations hovering in the air between them.
Emil woke some hours later to darkness, the room illuminated only by faint moonlight filtering through the curtains. Felix slept beside him, breathing deep and even despite the visible evidence of their shared decline. Emil studied him in the dim light, seeing with new clarity the multiple layers of their relationship—colleague, friend, and something more complex that had existed beneath the surface all along.
The protocol, which had provided structure and certainty for so long, seemed suddenly inadequate to map this new terrain. Emil found himself facing not only the physical consequences of years of restriction but the emotional landscape Felix's revelation had exposed—territory far more uncharted and dangerous than any medical crisis.
Yet within that danger, a strange possibility was emerging—a recognition that the connection between them might represent not threat but refuge, not disruption but a different kind of structure, one built on genuine understanding rather than clinical detachment.
Felix stirred slightly in his sleep, unconsciously shifting closer to Emil's warmth. Emil remained still, allowing the proximity without resistance, aware of both its medical necessity and its deeper significance. Tomorrow would bring the difficult terrain of recovery, the challenging landscape of proper refeeding, the complicated process of addressing years of carefully documented decline.
But it would also bring continued conversation, further calibration of understanding, additional mapping of the emotional territory Felix's revelation had exposed. Emil found himself approaching these prospects with a curious mixture of scientific interest and something less familiar—a tentative openness to possibilities beyond the precisely measured boundaries of his protocol.
Outside, Prague slept beneath the moon's pale illumination, buildings rendering sharp shadows across deserted streets. Inside, two figures lay side by side in the narrow bed, their physical forms documenting years of carefully orchestrated decline while their proximity suggested possibilities for a different kind of future—one measured not in centimeters of circumference or grams of weight, but in the more complex metrics of genuine connection.


### Either way, this follows: 

Morning arrived with gentle insistence, light filtering through the curtains to cast the room in diffuse gold. Emil woke first, finding himself still beside Felix, their positions having shifted during the night to an unconscious proximity that both medical necessity and newly acknowledged possibilities seemed to justify.
He allowed himself a moment of uncharacteristic stillness, observing Felix in repose. The sharp angles, the hollow spaces, the architectural precision of bone beneath skin—all registered with the familiar double vision, but now accompanied by a new awareness of what Felix had revealed about his perception of these features.
The thought that Felix found him attractive—had found him attractive for years—created a peculiar instability in Emil's carefully constructed understanding. It suggested that the physical form his protocol had documented with such precision might represent something entirely different when viewed through another's eyes.
Felix stirred, consciousness returning in visible stages—the slight change in breathing, the minimal adjustment of position, the moment when awareness visibly engaged. His eyes opened, immediately finding Emil's with the direct attention that had always characterized their interactions.
"Good morning," Felix said quietly, his voice carrying the particular raspiness that had become increasingly prominent as their shared condition progressed.
"Good morning," Emil replied, the simple exchange acquiring new weight in the aftermath of yesterday's revelations.
They regarded each other in silence for a moment, both apparently reluctant to disrupt the complicated peace of early morning with the necessary discussions ahead.
"Today," Emil said finally, professional authority providing structure for difficult territory, "we begin proper recovery. Not the halfhearted attempts of before, nor the deliberate avoidance that followed, but actual medical intervention."
Felix nodded, accepting this directive without protest. "What does that entail, precisely?"
The question engaged Emil's professional knowledge, providing welcome retreat to scientific territory. "Small, frequent meals of easily digestible nutrients. Gradual reintroduction of normal foods. Careful monitoring of physical response. Documentation of progress."
He paused, the next requirement more difficult to articulate. "And suspension of our investigation until basic physical recovery is established."
Felix's expression revealed momentary resistance before accepting the medical necessity. "For how long?"
"That depends on our progress," Emil replied, deliberately vague to prevent premature return to their work. "Certainly days, possibly weeks."
"The Protégé will not pause his activities while we recover," Felix observed, the concern genuine rather than manipulative.
"The Protégé will find little value in specimens too depleted to properly examine," Emil countered, the clinical detachment of his statement undermined by the slight shudder that accompanied it.
Felix acknowledged this with a slight nod, the reminder of their vulnerability apparently sufficient to overcome his resistance. "Then we proceed according to your medical expertise," he conceded. "Though I suspect the psychological aspects may prove more challenging than the physical."
The simple observation contained volumes of understanding, both of Emil's condition and their shared situation. Emil found himself studying Felix with new attention, seeing not merely the colleague and friend of years but someone who had observed him with deeper insight than he had recognized.
"Yes," Emil agreed quietly. "The mind creates more resistance than the body."
They rose with careful deliberation, each movement requiring specific concentration, both navigating the complicated terrain between intention and capacity. In the kitchen, Emil approached the preparation of their first meal with the same precision he had applied to his measurements—calculating appropriate portions, selecting digestible components, arranging everything with clinical efficiency.
The result was modest by normal standards—soft-boiled eggs, thin slices of toast, weak tea—but represented a significant disruption to their recent patterns. They seated themselves at the small table, the simple meal between them acquiring the significance of a medical procedure.
Emil watched as Felix took the first careful bite, noting the moment of hesitation, the visible effort required to overcome the body's confusion at this deviation from established pattern.
"Small amounts," Emil reminded him, professional guidance providing structure for difficult terrain. "Chew thoroughly. Allow time between bites."
Felix nodded, following these instructions with careful precision. Emil found himself delaying his own participation, ostensibly to monitor Felix's response but recognizing the avoidance inherent in his observation.
"You as well, Emil," Felix said quietly, the gentle reminder containing no judgment, merely recognition of shared difficulty.
Emil acknowledged this with a slight nod, turning his attention to his own plate. The first bite required more courage than he cared to acknowledge, the simple act of consuming actual nourishment representing a fundamental breach of the protocol that had governed his existence for years.
They ate in silence, each navigating the complicated terrain of reintroduction—the body's simultaneous hunger and resistance, the mind's conflicting impulses toward nourishment and restriction. When they had finished, Felix looked up with an expression that combined genuine relief and lingering anxiety.
"That wasn't as terrible as anticipated," he observed, a hint of his usual wry humor briefly visible.
"The initial phase is often less difficult than expected," Emil replied, falling into the patterns of medical exposition. "It's the sustained practice that presents greater challenges."
Felix studied him with careful attention. "You speak from experience as well as professional knowledge."
The simple observation penetrated Emil's clinical detachment with unexpected precision. He looked away, unable to maintain eye contact under the weight of Felix's gentle insight.
"Yes," he acknowledged finally, the admission both medical and deeply personal. "This is not my first experience with reintroducing nutrition."
The revelation hung in the air between them, its implications expanding to fill the small kitchen. Felix made no immediate response, allowing the statement to exist without demand for elaboration.
"When?" he asked finally, the single word requesting information rather than explanation.
"During my medical training," Emil replied, finding unexpected relief in articulating what had remained unspoken for so long. "It became... noticeable. Intervention was arranged."
Felix looked at him, a thought coming together visibly. "The semester I was abroad," he stated. 
"Yes."
"I remember the rumors I heard about you when I returned," Felix said. "I determined they were spurious and intentionally disregarded them."
"I appreciate your discretion," Emil said, the words carrying a hint of his usual dry humor. "Being looked at as a student and not a specimen was greatly preferred."
"And yet here we are," Felix said.
Emil gestured vaguely, the movement encompassing their current situation. "Success was temporary. The patterns returned, though with greater sophistication in concealment."
Felix nodded slowly, absorbing this information with the careful attention he typically applied to architectural details. "And now?" he asked, the question containing layers of inquiry about both physical and emotional terrain.
Emil considered this, examining his current state with the clinical detachment he had cultivated for years. "Now," he said carefully, "I find myself in uncharted territory. The protocol has been disrupted beyond repair, yet its ghost remains. I move between worlds, belonging fully to neither."
The unusual poetry of this response seemed to affect Felix deeply. He reached across the table, his hand entering Emil's field of vision—an offer rather than demand, invitation rather than insistence.
Emil regarded the extended hand, experiencing the now-familiar doubling effect—seeing simultaneously the physical reality before him and the complex emotional architecture beneath it. With deliberate motion, he placed his own hand in Felix's, the simple contact—skin against skin, bone against bone—registering with startling clarity.
"Perhaps," Felix suggested quietly, "we might navigate this unmapped terrain together. As we have our investigation."
The offer contained no pressure, no expectation, merely the possibility of shared journey rather than solitary struggle. Emil found himself tightening his grip slightly, the gesture conveying acceptance that words would have rendered too vulnerable.
They remained thus connected across the small table, amid the evidence of their first successful meal, both acknowledging the difficult path ahead while recognizing they would not walk it alone.
The day unfolded in a pattern of small meals and careful rest, each approaching the process of recovery with the deliberate precision their professional training had instilled. Emil documented everything—portions consumed, physical responses, recovery markers—with the same methodical care he had applied to his protocol, though now directed toward healing rather than reduction.
By evening, they had successfully managed four small meals without incident—a medical victory that Emil noted in his journal with scientific satisfaction. The physical effects were minimal but present—a slight reduction in tremor, a modest increase in energy, the first tentative steps toward reversing years of carefully documented decline.
As they prepared for sleep, the question of arrangements arose without explicit discussion. Felix looked toward his bedroom door, then back at Emil, his expression containing neither demand nor expectation, merely acknowledgment of choice.
"The proximity provides medical benefit," Emil observed, the scientific justification offered without conscious deliberation. "Shared warmth enhances recovery in our current condition."
Felix nodded, accepting this explanation without comment on its potential additional motivations. "A practical consideration," he agreed, a hint of his usual wry humor briefly visible beneath the physical exhaustion.
They settled into Felix's bed with the synchronicity of longtime companions, each finding their position with unspoken coordination. The narrow space required proximity, their bodies separated by layers of nightclothes but close enough for shared warmth.
"It will become more difficult," Emil said into the darkness, professional honesty compelling the warning. "The initial phase often proceeds smoothly, but resistance typically intensifies as recovery progresses."
"I anticipate challenges," Felix replied quietly. "Both physical and otherwise."
The simple acknowledgment contained volumes of understanding—of Emil's condition, of their shared situation, of the complicated terrain ahead. Emil found himself unexpectedly comforted by this recognition, by Felix's willingness to see difficulty without being deterred by it.
"We should resume our investigation within the week," Emil added, unable to entirely abandon their work despite his earlier medical directive. "The Protégé remains a threat requiring attention."
"When our condition permits," Felix agreed, the qualification suggesting he had adopted Emil's medical perspective regarding their priorities. "Though we might continue theoretical discussions during recovery."
The compromise satisfied Emil's need for continued purpose while respecting the physical limitations of their current state. He nodded slightly, forgetting momentarily that the darkness rendered the gesture invisible.
"Yes," he said instead, the single word carrying multiple layers of agreement—to the compromise, to their shared recovery, to the uncertain path ahead.
They lay in silence after that, side by side in the narrow bed, close enough for awareness of each other's presence but maintaining the minimum distance propriety demanded even in these extraordinary circumstances. Emil listened as Felix's breathing gradually slowed and deepened, indicating he had drifted into sleep.
Emil remained awake longer, his mind processing the events of recent days with the analytical precision he applied to all phenomena. The protocol, which had provided structure and certainty for so long, had been fundamentally disrupted, leaving him in territory both unknown and strangely familiar—the landscape of recovery he had navigated once before, though under very different circumstances.
Yet unlike that previous journey, this time he did not walk alone. Felix moved beside him in sleep, unconsciously shifting closer to Emil's warmth, the simple proximity containing possibilities beyond the precisely measured boundaries of protocol and profession.
Outside, Prague settled into night, occasional carriages passing on the street below, their wheels creating rhythmic patterns against cobblestones. Inside, two figures lay side by side in the narrow bed, their physical forms documenting years of carefully orchestrated decline while their proximity suggested possibilities for a different kind of future—one measured not in centimeters of circumference or grams of weight, but in the more complex metrics of genuine connection.
Emil closed his eyes finally, surrendering to the exhaustion that accompanied even this first day of tentative recovery.
