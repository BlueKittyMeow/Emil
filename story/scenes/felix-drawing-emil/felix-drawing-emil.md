The Sketch Critique Scene

Felix's apartment, evening, rain against windows
The rain had persisted since morning, the steady rhythm against Felix's windows creating a comfortable isolation from the rest of Prague. Emil had arrived damp despite his umbrella, and now sat near the coal stove with a cup of tea he had barely touched.
Felix worked at his drawing table, the lamp creating a pool of amber light over several sketches. He had been organizing his portfolio—architectural studies, historical building details, and the occasional figure drawing. Emil glanced over occasionally, his attention caught by Felix's methodical sorting.
"This might interest you," Felix said, selecting a sketch and bringing it to where Emil sat. "The Klementinum library. I'm documenting the interior details for the restoration committee."
Emil examined the drawing with professional attention. Felix had captured the baroque splendor of the ceiling with remarkable precision, the architectural details rendered with both technical accuracy and artistic appreciation.
"Your eye for detail is impressive," Emil said, handing the sketch back.
Felix returned to his table, casually setting aside several other drawings before pausing at one particular sketch. He studied it briefly before turning back to Emil.
"I forgot I had this one," he said, his tone deliberately light. "From the medical society lecture last month."
He offered the drawing to Emil, who accepted it with the same clinical detachment he had shown the architectural sketch. But his expression shifted subtly as he recognized himself at the podium, captured in Felix's precise lines.
Emil studied the image with the same careful attention he might give a medical specimen. Felix had drawn him in profile, his focus on his notes, one hand raised to emphasize a point. The proportions were accurate, the posture characteristic, but something in the rendering made Emil's brow furrow slightly.
"You've made me look far too thin," Emil said, his tone carefully neutral despite the complex calculation happening behind his eyes.
Felix leaned against his drawing table, arms folded casually. "That's precisely how you appeared."
"Surely not," Emil replied, studying the sketch again. "The perspective must have created a distortion."
"I draw what I see," Felix said simply. "My architectural work requires accurate proportion."
Emil's fingers traced the outline of the figure—the sharp angle of the jawline, the hollow beneath the cheekbone, the space visible between neck and collar. His expression remained unreadable, caught between hoping Felix was wrong and needing him to be right.
"You've always had a tendency toward the dramatic in your figure studies," Emil said, attempting to sound amused rather than defensive.
Felix took the sketch back, examining it with professional objectivity. "I could compare it with earlier sketches if you wish. I have several from university days."
A barely perceptible tension appeared in Emil's shoulders. "That's hardly necessary."
Felix returned the sketch to his portfolio without comment, but his eyes remained on Emil, seeing both the physical changes and the careful denial. The rain continued against the windows, filling the silence between them.
"Another cup of tea?" Felix offered, knowing it would likely remain untouched like the first.
"No, thank you," Emil replied, already standing. "I should review my notes for tomorrow's lecture."
Felix nodded, not pressing the issue. "Of course."
As Emil gathered his papers, Felix returned to organizing his sketches, including the one of Emil among the others—one more document in the visual record he kept. Both men maintained the fiction that nothing significant had happened, that no boundaries had been approached.
The rain would continue all night, Felix knew. He would complete another sketch of Emil from memory after his friend left—one more image in the chronological documentation of Emil's gradual disappearance.
"I'll walk with you to the university tomorrow if the rain stops," Felix said as Emil prepared to leave.
"If you wish," Emil replied, the familiar dance of care and distance continuing between them.
After Emil departed, Felix retrieved the sketch again, studying the figure he had drawn with an artist's precision. He had not exaggerated the thinness—if anything, he had slightly softened the reality. The drawings from their university days showed a different man entirely, the transformation documented in dozens of sketches Felix had created over the years.
He returned the sketch to its place in the chronological collection, each image a record of Emil's slow fading, visible to Felix's artist eye but impossible to address directly between them.

The Long Walk in the Rain
Prague streets, evening, steady rain
Emil stepped from the shelter of Felix's doorway into the rain. His umbrella provided minimal protection against the slanting downpour, but the physical discomfort registered as little more than data—temperature approximately twelve degrees Celsius, wind from the northeast, rainfall moderate to heavy.
He had no intention of returning to his apartment, despite what he'd told Felix. The thought of sitting at his desk, confronted by the lecture notes that needed revision, felt suffocating after the sketch incident. His feet carried him past the turning that would lead to his rooms, continuing instead along the darkening streets.
The gaslights of Prague created wavering coronas in the rain. Emil calculated his route with practiced efficiency—the longer path around the university district, past the shuttered shops, down toward the river. Two hours of walking would correct for the tea he'd accepted at Felix's apartment, though he'd barely touched it. The rain added resistance, increasing the expenditure of energy. Satisfactory.
But his mind refused to perform the usual calming calculations of calories and distance. Instead, it circled relentlessly around the sketch Felix had shown him.
Far too thin, he had said, the lie careful and deliberate. But Felix had contradicted him with the simple assurance of someone stating objective fact rather than opinion. That's precisely how you appeared.
Emil's pace quickened slightly. What other sketches remained in Felix's portfolio? He had mentioned university days, but which period? Before the collapse, when Emil had been disgustingly soft, undisciplined? Or after, during recovery, when they had forced him to regain what he had so carefully eliminated?
Or—a thought that both pleased and disturbed him—had Felix begun sketching him only after they became friends, when Emil had already achieved a more acceptable form? The first time they spoke properly had been after Felix's return from abroad, after Emil's absence from the university. Emil had already been under medical supervision then, already been forced to compromise his discipline in order to return to his studies.
The rain soaked through the shoulders of his coat, but Emil barely registered it. His mind constructed and reconstructed the timeline with scientific precision, attempting to determine which version of himself existed in Felix's sketches.
He passed the dark windows of Anton's grocery, closed hours ago. The grocer had become increasingly forward with his concern, speaking to Emil in Czech as if the shared language permitted such intrusions. The dumplings had been the latest offense—Emil had disposed of them in a public trash bin three streets from his apartment.
The Vltava appeared through the rain as he approached the embankment. In summer, this area would be crowded with evening strollers, but now only a few hurried figures moved through the downpour, heads bent against the weather. Emil walked along the river's edge, the sound of rain on water creating a constant static that crowded out thought.
Felix saw too much. That was the problem. Most people observed only what confirmed their existing beliefs, but Felix's artist eye recorded with mechanical precision. Emil had recognized himself in that sketch—the sharpness of his features, the collar that no longer fit properly despite being his smallest size. Felix had captured exactly how he appeared rather than how Emil needed to be seen.
It was the accuracy that disturbed him most. Not exaggeration, but truth.
A figure emerged from the rain ahead, moving toward the sheltered area beneath a bridge. As Emil drew closer, he recognized the distinctive shape of Dr. Weber's umbrella and the professor's characteristic gait. Emil altered his course immediately, turning up a side street to avoid the encounter. Weber had been watching him with increasing attention in recent weeks, his clinical gaze too similar to Felix's artistic one—seeing what Emil worked to conceal.
The rain intensified, but Emil continued walking, his route now taking him in a wide arc that would eventually return him to his rooms. His coat hung heavy with water, the added weight requiring additional energy to move. The calculation offered brief comfort—kilometers traveled, energy expended, balance maintained.
But his mind returned to Felix's apartment, to the careful neutrality in his friend's eyes when Emil had challenged the sketch. Felix hadn't argued. He'd simply stated what he saw, then offered to show earlier sketches—evidence from a time Emil preferred not to remember.
A memory surfaced unexpectedly—Felix appearing in the library after his return from abroad, settling across from Emil without comment or question when others had approached with careful concern or evident discomfort. Felix had simply begun sketching the library's architectural details, occasionally asking Emil about a medical text he was reviewing, treating him with neither the excessive solicitude nor the barely concealed curiosity that had characterized other interactions.
That normalcy had been like oxygen after months of being observed as a medical specimen. Felix had seen him clearly even then, but had chosen not to comment on what he saw.
Emil paused beneath the temporary shelter of an archway, water streaming from his saturated clothing. In the distance, the dark shape of the hospital was just visible through the rain—the place where he had spent three months under observation before being permitted to return to his studies. He still avoided that entire district when possible, taking longer routes to circumvent the memories housed there.
Something from Felix's drawing table flashed in his memory—a partial glimpse of another sketch showing the back view of a figure that might have been him, seated at a lecture. Had Felix been documenting his decline all along, creating a visual medical record without Emil's knowledge or consent?
The thought should have angered him, but instead produced a strange, disturbing comfort. Someone was witnessing his transformation, recording the progress he himself tracked in numbers and measurements. Felix's sketches were a kind of validation—evidence that the changes Emil worked toward were visible, real.
By the time he reached his apartment building, Emil's clothing was completely soaked through, his skin chilled. He calculated the additional energy his body would expend generating heat to compensate for the drop in temperature. The household staff would have retired hours ago, leaving him to navigate the darkened stairway alone.
In his rooms, he methodically removed his wet clothing, hanging each piece precisely to dry. His reflection in the mirror above his washstand caught his attention—the sharp angles of his face emphasized in the harsh lamplight, the hollow beneath each cheekbone exactly as Felix had rendered it.
You've made me look far too thin, he had said.
That's precisely how you appeared, Felix had answered.
Emil traced the outline of his collarbone with clinical detachment. Felix saw clearly. That was the threat—and the strange comfort—he presented. In a world where Emil carefully managed others' perceptions, Felix simply observed and recorded without judgment or intervention.
On his desk, the lecture notes waited, but Emil instead took out his own notebook—the leather-bound record of his private measurements and calculations. He added the evening's data with scientific precision: estimated distance walked, duration, weather conditions, probable energy expenditure.
In a moment of unusual impulse, he noted in the margin: F. sketch—accurate observation. The admission felt both dangerous and necessary, like a scientific truth that complicated a cherished theory but couldn't be ignored.
Outside his window, Prague disappeared into the darkness and rain, the city becoming a collection of scattered lights and indistinct shapes. Somewhere across those blurred lights, Felix would be completing his own documentation—architectural details and perhaps another sketch from memory, adding to the visual record of Emil's careful disappearance.
Emil closed his notebook and finally turned to his lecture notes, the evening's walking having restored his ability to focus. Tomorrow would require precision, discipline. Felix would likely be waiting to walk with him to the university, umbrella in hand, observing but not commenting on Emil's late-night journey through the rain.
There was comfort in being seen without being stopped. For now, at least, that delicate balance could be maintained.

Morning Revelations
Emil's apartment, early morning
Half-past five. Emil completed his morning measurements with practiced efficiency, the ritual unchanged despite the previous night's rain-soaked wandering. The numbers in his ledger showed minimal variation from yesterday—disappointing after nearly three hours of walking in cold rain.
His reflection in the mirror offered more detailed analysis as he dressed. The collar bone too visible, yes, but not prominent enough. The hollow beneath his cheekbones present but insufficiently defined. His wrists remained too thick, the knobs of bone not pronounced enough for proper aesthetic proportion.
He had been better before. During university, before the collapse, he had achieved a purity of form that still eluded him now. His current state was a poor approximation—controlled, but lacking the transcendent discipline of that earlier time.
And Felix had seen it all.
The realization struck with unexpected force as Emil fastened his collar. Felix's sketches must document everything—not just his current inadequate condition, but the comparison with his past. Felix would have visual proof that Emil remained lesser than his former self.
Emil reached for his waistcoat, the tailored fabric hanging loose despite recent alterations. What if Felix had drawn him in his prime? Did he recognize how far Emil still needed to go to recapture that ideal state?
The room tilted slightly as Emil bent to retrieve his shoes, a momentary vertigo that forced him to grasp the edge of his washstand. Lack of sleep, perhaps, or lingering chill from the rain. He straightened carefully, waiting for the sensation to pass.
Felix would be arriving soon to walk with him to the university. Felix, whose eyes missed nothing, who drew what he saw with unflinching accuracy. The thought produced a confusion of responses—dread alongside something warmer and more dangerous.
Emil crushed the latter feeling immediately. Foolish, that's another illness of yours, he told himself firmly. The professional relationship with Felix served Emil's research and career. Nothing more could be permitted.
He reached for his coat, still faintly damp from the previous night's soaking. The weight of it would increase energy expenditure during their walk—a minor compensation for yesterday's inadequate results.
As he fastened the coat buttons, another wave of vertigo washed over him, stronger than before. Emil gripped the back of his desk chair, breathing through the sensation with clinical detachment. His pulse had accelerated—ninety-two beats per minute, well above his normal resting rate. Insufficient sleep, inadequate recovery time after extensive walking. Acceptable explanations.
The weakness passed after sixty-seven seconds. Emil straightened his posture, adjusted his collar, and reached for his daily ledger. No need to record the episode. Temporary fluctuations were statistically insignificant.
A knock at the door announced Felix's arrival, precisely on schedule. Emil composed his features into professional neutrality before opening the door.
The Morning Walk
Outside Emil's apartment building
Felix stood on the doorstep with his umbrella tucked under one arm, though the morning had dawned unexpectedly clear after the night's deluge. He carried his leather portfolio and a small package wrapped in brown paper.
"Good morning," he said, his expression brightening as Emil appeared. "I brought coffee from that place near the Powder Tower." He offered the package. "They had those almond pastries you used to favor."
Emil accepted the coffee with carefully measured gratitude, ignoring the pastry comment entirely. "Thank you. The morning air is bracing."
Felix fell into step beside him with characteristic ease, seemingly untroubled by Emil's non-response regarding the pastry. "This may be of interest to you, Emil," he said, his tone conversational rather than formal. Felix had always addressed him by his first name in private since that initial coffee house conversation, the familiarity established and never questioned. "I'm processing a collection from one of your professional cohort."
Emil sipped the coffee, grateful for its warmth after the chill that seemed to have settled in his bones since the previous night. "Which collection?"
"Dr. Hartmann's estate. His widow donated his papers and personal effects to the historical society." Felix navigated around a puddle from the previous night's rain. "The finding aid mentions medical specimens, but several items listed seem to be missing."
Emil maintained his pace carefully, matching Felix's longer stride while conserving energy. "Administrative errors in catalogs are common."
"True, but these discrepancies follow a pattern. All the missing items relate to unusual medical conditions or anatomical anomalies." Felix glanced sideways at Emil. "The specimens themselves may never have been donated, but the documentation clearly references them."
Their route took them past the university's medical building, its gothic architecture stark against the morning sky. Emil calculated the calories in the coffee—approximately forty-five, acceptable given the morning chill and yesterday's extended walking.
"The most interesting aspect," Felix continued, "is that several of the missing specimens apparently came from a single collector who frequently purchased items from university collections. No name is provided, only initials."
Emil nodded, dividing his attention between Felix's words and the management of his own physical state. The vertigo had not returned, but a persistent lightheadedness remained, requiring additional concentration to maintain his usual precise gait.
As they turned onto a narrow street still shadowed from the morning sun, Felix reached suddenly to grasp Emil's elbow as he stepped into an unseen puddle.
"Careful," Felix said, then paused, his hand lingering on Emil's arm. "How on earth is your coat still soaked?"
Emil withdrew slightly from the contact, the pressure of Felix's fingers against his arm registering with uncomfortable intensity. "It will dry eventually."
Felix frowned, maintaining his light grip on Emil's elbow as they navigated the slippery cobblestones. "You should have mentioned it was still wet. I have several you could borrow."
In Prague, unlike London, such physical contact between professional men was less common, though not remarkable between established friends. Still, Emil noted that Felix's hand on his arm would be visible to any colleagues they might encounter. The thought produced another wave of conflicting responses that Emil firmly suppressed.
"The dampness is minimal," Emil replied, calculating how to redirect the conversation. "Tell me more about this collector. Could there be professional implications if university specimens were sold inappropriately?"
The diversionary tactic worked. Felix released Emil's arm as they reached a wider street, his expression shifting to professional consideration.
"That's my concern. The initials match several prominent figures, but the pattern suggests someone with specific medical interests." Felix adjusted his portfolio under his arm. "There's always the possibility of simple record-keeping errors, but the consistency is troubling."
As they approached the university gates, Emil noted several colleagues ahead. He increased the distance between himself and Felix slightly—a habitual adjustment whenever they moved from private to public spaces.
"I could review the medical aspects of the collection," Emil offered, genuine professional interest mixing with the desire to maintain Felix's focus on the historical puzzle rather than Emil's physical state.
Felix nodded, his attention momentarily captured by the architectural details of a building across the street. "I'd appreciate that. There are references to conditions I'm unfamiliar with." He turned back to Emil with a smile. "Sometime this week? I'll bring the relevant documents."
Emil agreed, already calculating which evening would least disrupt his carefully structured routine. Felix's company was... acceptable. His observations were uncomfortably accurate, yes, but his lack of intervention made him safer than most.
At the university entrance, they paused, their paths diverging—Felix to the historical society offices, Emil to the medical faculty building.
"Until tomorrow, then," Felix said, his artist's eyes taking in Emil's appearance one final time before he departed.
Emil wondered which details would appear in tonight's sketch—the damp coat, perhaps, or the momentary unsteadiness on the wet cobblestones. Felix missed nothing, yet said little. The thought was both disturbing and oddly comforting as Emil turned toward his laboratory, already calculating the day's careful balance of appearances and realities.
Behind him, Felix walked away, his portfolio containing yesterday's sketches and notes about missing specimens from a collector whose interest in medical anomalies seemed increasingly significant. Two separate mysteries, unfolding in parallel, neither yet recognized as connected.
