# Introduction Chapter

## Notes
Winter morning, Vltava River frozen. Emil's precise winter walking routine, Felix documenting ice damage to historical buildings. Prague's winter beauty masking institutional/personal rigidities. Their paths cross over shared concern about weather damage to university facilities.

Felix's sketching hands - opening not with Emil but Felix drawing architectural decay, his fingers tracing what's crumbling while trying to preserve it.



## Actual Draft Text
For centuries, the Vltava River had been eating away at Prague's flesh, licking away at it with its rasped tongue. It sighed and laid itself down along the city, shifting a bit to make itself more at ease. Lapping into the mortar joints, breathing foggy breath into the sills and cornices, it claimed the city as its own. 

There had been efforts to resist this undignified intrusion. The stone embankments had been laid in place in protest against the flooded streets and moistened basements. The river in turn accepted this d√©tente as reasonable terms for their coexistence. 

Springtime brought the deluge, the lavish laving of the river's tongue devolving into a frenetic excess. Snowmelt from the mountain thaws surged downstream, seeping into the city's pores. The summer saw a lassitude, a sundrenched slipping into daydreams and sleep. 

Autumn was met with a stretching exhalation, the river shaking out the fallen leaves, clogging the workings of the weirs and races, but still unwilling to be stirred to more than lazy motion. 

But winter carved the deepest. The Vltava raked against the masonry, prying its claws into the cracks between the coursework, baring the bones beneath the flesh. 

Felix's hands sketched quickly, as if the cold had caused a tremor in his fingers, but his lines were sharp as ever. Emil watched him as he brought the distant building close to them, crafting a miniature within the edges of the page. 

Though he lacked the training of his companion, Emil could see the damage that the ice was working on the stonework that sat against the embankment. The lowest stones were cracked, their mortar flaking, the pitting stark in contrast to their newer neighbors. 

"It's not so bad," Felix said absently, eyes flicking from the building to the page. "The brewing mill at Kampa was clearly worse, timber is always a complication."






## Later

Felix sighed and snapped his sketchbook closed with a flick of his wrist. They fell in step along the bank, the gentle creaking of the ice as familiar as the sighs of patients on the ward. 

"You will be going on your evening walk?" Felix asked. 
Emil considered briefly. Their evening walk had been longer than usual, Felix eager to note the damage to nearly a dozen different buildings scattered along the banks. Long enough, sidling right up to the edge of overlong. 
"Not tonight," Emil said, "I have lecture notes to review for tomorrow."
Felix nodded and set off towards Emil's apartments.
