Winter morning, Vltava River frozen. Emil's precise winter walking routine, Felix documenting ice damage to historical buildings. Prague's winter beauty masking institutional/personal rigidities. Their paths cross over shared concern about weather damage to university facilities.


Felix's sketching hands - opening not with Emil but Felix drawing architectural decay, his fingers tracing what's crumbling while trying to preserve it.


For centuries, the Vltava had been eating away at Prague's flesh, licking away at it with its rasped tongue. It sighed and laid itself down along the city, shifting a bit to make itself more at ease. Lapping into the mortar joints, breathing foggy breath into the sills and cornices, it claimed the city as its own. 

There had been efforts to resist this undignified intrusion. The stone embankments had been laid in place as protestation against the flooded streets and moistened basements. The river in turn accepted this detent as reasonable terms for their coexistence. 

While the springtime brought the deluge, the lavish laving of the river's tongue devolving into an excess, wetly seeping into the city's pores, and the .... , winter carved the deepest, prying its claws into the cracks in the joists, baring the bones beneath the flesh.
