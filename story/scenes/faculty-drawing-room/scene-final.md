Faculty Drawing Room Scene

Half-past eight. The faculty drawing room clock marked the hour with precision, its mechanism operating with the reliability expected of the medical professionals gathered beneath its face. Rain persisted against the windowpanes, transforming the glass into a study of fluid dynamics.

Emil Králik occupied the leather armchair positioned at a calculated distance from the hearth – near enough for propriety, far enough to avoid the heat that would draw attention to his aversion. His wine glass remained nearly full, a prop in the social ritual unfolding around him.

By day, this room hosted committee meetings; by night, it transformed into something between a gentleman's club and a medical theater. Tonight's demonstration: clinical cases dissected for the edification of colleagues. The portraits of former department chairs observed from their frames, their expressions suggesting judgment of both technique and narrative.

Dr. Hoffman adjusted his pince-nez with his left hand while gesturing with his right. "The thoracic calcification progressed in a dendritic pattern, visible through the epidermis by week fourteen. We documented the progression through measurement and photography."

The branching pattern he described resembled the arterial system rendered in chalk-white beneath living skin. Emil had seen similar formations in the pathology collection, preserved in formaldehyde and labeled in perfect script.

"The terminal outcome?" Dr. Meyer inquired from his position by the bookshelf.

A pause, during which Hoffman's clinical mask slipped momentarily. "Instructive. The subject remained conscious until the final phase."

Tobacco smoke accumulated near the ceiling in layers. A servant materialized at Emil's elbow, decanter poised.

"No," Emil said, covering his glass with three fingers. "Thank you."

The pressure of the crystal against his fingertips registered with unusual clarity.

Dr. Bartoš cleared his throat, the sound calibrated to command attention without appearing overtly demanding. "I documented a case last autumn with most unusual temporal characteristics. Female, twenty-two years, presenting with seizures that occurred exclusively at sunset, commencing within minutes of the sun's disappearance below the horizon."

"Duration?" Dr. Weber inquired.

"Precisely twelve minutes, without variation." Bartoš measured his words with the same precision with which he measured his patient's convulsions. "The patient maintained consciousness throughout, reporting auditory hallucinations of a musical nature despite no formal training."

Emil observed the subtle shifts in posture among his colleagues—the slight forward inclination, the narrowing of eyes, the momentary cessation of smoking. The familiar indicators of professional fascination.

"Most curiously," Bartoš continued, "the condition terminated completely on December twenty-first. No gradual improvement, no residual symptoms—simply present one evening and absent the next."

"The subject's physical condition during these episodes?" Dr. Hoffman's question carried the undercurrent of professional rivalry.

"Remarkable stability," Bartoš replied, satisfaction evident. "Despite her inability to accept nourishment during episodes, her physical measurements remained unchanged throughout the observation period. Not a kilogram lost over three months of recurrent seizures."

The faculty drawing room seemed to recede in Emil's perception. His attention divided between the external performance of attentive colleague and the internal calculus of compensation. The wine would require correction—walking, perhaps, later that evening, regardless of the rain.

Professor Weber's voice reached Emil intermittently as he described neural degeneration in a patient. Emil registered fragments only—"progressive paralysis," "retained sensory function," "unusual preservation of memory"—while his mind drifted to the leather-bound notebook in his desk drawer, its entries organized by date, weight, intake, and expenditure.

"Dr. Králik."

The sound of his name restored his focus. Professor Weber regarded him with professional expectation, the moment of contribution having arrived. Emil raised his wine glass with deliberate steadiness, an action that bought him seconds for composition of thought.

"Yes," he responded, his voice modulated to the pitch of clinical authority. "I observed a case some years ago with particularly instructive documentation aspects. Male, early thirties, academic background, presenting initially with symptoms consistent with nervous exhaustion."

The leather armchair emitted a slight creak as he adjusted his position. His colleagues arranged themselves in the attitudes of professional attention, a tableau of scientific observation.

"The subject exhibited unusual commitment to self-documentation," Emil continued. "He maintained records with a degree of clinical detachment one rarely encounters outside formal medical training."

He permitted himself the smallest possible contact with the wine before proceeding. "His documentation followed laboratory protocols in precision. Nutritional intake measured by volume—primarily clear broths in carefully restricted quantities. Physical activity recorded in regular increments with corresponding physiological effects: tremors after hours of continuous ambulation, vertiginous episodes when the activity extended further, followed by what the subject described as 'a sensation of corporeal transcendence' in the final hour."

The room had assumed the quality of an anatomy theater. His colleagues' attention focused with the intensity found in dissection demonstrations, that particular scientific hunger that transforms a body into a text.

"The most significant aspect was the subject's elaborate system of rationalization regarding his physical deterioration. Despite maintaining weight records with unusual precision—noting each reduction with evident satisfaction—he categorically rejected correlation between his diminished physical capacity and his systematic restriction of nourishment. Weakness was attributed to intellectual exertion; tremors were catalogued as evidence of nervous refinement; progressive emaciation was documented as an optimization of intellectual efficiency."

Professor Weber's notebook lay open on his knee, his pencil making the careful notations of a pathologist. The clock marked quarter past nine with mechanical indifference.

"The case resolved through institutional intervention. The subject was remanded to a medical facility until sufficient physical restoration enabled return to professional responsibilities." Emil placed his wine glass on the side table. "His documentation proved valuable to understanding the cognitive architecture of such conditions, particularly the systematic nature of self-deception."

Silence expanded to fill the drawing room, broken only by the rhythm of rain against glass and the occasional adjustment of colleague against leather.

"Most illuminating," Professor Weber said finally. "The documentation methods—you retain access to these records?"

"They demonstrate unusual thoroughness," Emil replied, professional distance maintained with care. "Confidentiality prevents specific disclosure, naturally, but the methodological approach warrants attention. Daily entries adhered to consistent format: 'Morning nutrition declined—lecture preparation requires optimal mental clarity. Midday sustenance unnecessary—research efficiency at peak levels. Evening walk extended to several hours—essential for cerebral circulation. Current physical measurements optimal for intellectual function.'"

His colleagues absorbed this information with expressions of professional interest rather than personal concern. None appeared to register the slight tremor in his right hand as he retrieved his wine glass, nor the calculations occurring behind his attentive expression.

As the next presentation commenced, Emil withdrew into the private arithmetic of his internal ledger. The rain continued its percussion against the windowpanes. In their gilt frames, the former chairs of medicine observed with the detached interest of researchers noting the progress of an experimental subject.

The faculty drawing room continued its function as a theater of medical observation, while outside, night pressed against the windows with the weight of scientific certainty.
