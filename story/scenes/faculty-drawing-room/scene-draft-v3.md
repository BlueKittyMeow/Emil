# Faculty Drawing Room Scene - Draft

## Version 3

Half-past eight. The faculty drawing room clock marked the hour with precision, its mechanism operating with the same reliable efficiency expected of the medical professionals gathered beneath its face. Rain persisted against the windowpanes, transforming the glass into an ever-changing study of fluid dynamics, each droplet tracking its inevitable descent.

Emil Králik occupied the leather armchair positioned at a comfortable distance from the hearth – near enough for propriety, far enough to avoid the excessive warmth that would draw attention to his aversion to heat. His wine glass remained nearly full, barely touched since it had been poured earlier in the evening. The glass served primarily as a prop, a necessary element in the carefully choreographed social ritual unfolding around him.

By day, this room hosted committee meetings and administrative functions; by night, it underwent a transformation into something between a gentleman's club and a medical theater. Tonight's demonstration: each faculty member dissecting his most unusual case for the edification of colleagues. The portraits of former department chairs observed from their frames, their stern expressions suggesting judgment of both clinical technique and narrative skill.

Dr. Hoffman adjusted his pince-nez with his left hand while gesturing with his right, the motion practiced and deliberate. "The thoracic calcification progressed in a dendritic pattern, visible through the epidermis by week fourteen. We documented the progression through both measurement and photography."

The branching pattern he described with his fingers resembled nothing so much as the arterial system rendered in chalk-white beneath living skin. Emil had seen similar formations in the pathology collection, preserved in formaldehyde and labeled in perfect script.

"The terminal outcome?" Dr. Meyer inquired from his position by the bookshelf.

A pause, during which Hoffman's clinical mask slipped momentarily. "Instructive," he replied finally. "The subject remained conscious until the final phase, providing valuable observations regarding sensation."

Tobacco smoke accumulated near the ceiling in layers, stratified like geological formations. A servant materialized at Emil's elbow, decanter poised at the regulation angle.

"No," Emil said, covering his glass with a careful placement of three fingers. "Thank you."

The pressure of the crystal against his fingertips registered with unusual clarity. The servant retreated, moving around the assembled faculty.

Dr. Bartoš cleared his throat, the sound calibrated to command attention without appearing overtly demanding. "I documented a case last autumn with most unusual temporal characteristics. Female, twenty-two years, presenting with seizures that occurred exclusively at sunset, commencing within minutes of the sun's disappearance below the horizon."

"Duration?" Dr. Weber inquired, his tone suggesting both collegial interest and professional assessment.

"Precisely twelve minutes, without variation." Bartoš measured his words with the same precision with which he no doubt measured his patient's convulsions. "The patient maintained consciousness throughout, reporting auditory hallucinations of a consistent musical nature despite no formal training or notable musical aptitude."

Emil observed the subtle shifts in posture among his colleagues—the slight forward inclination, the narrowing of eyes, the momentary cessation of smoking. The familiar indicators of professional fascination, recognizable to those who knew the signs.

"Most curiously," Bartoš continued, "the condition terminated completely on December twenty-first. No gradual improvement, no residual symptoms—simply present one evening and absent the next."

"The subject's physical condition during these episodes?" Dr. Hoffman's question carried the unmistakable undercurrent of professional rivalry, the desire to locate weaknesses in another's case study.

"Remarkable stability," Bartoš replied, satisfaction evident in his features. "Despite her inability to accept nourishment during episodes, her physical measurements remained unchanged throughout the observation period. Not a kilogram lost over three months of recurrent seizures."

The faculty drawing room seemed to recede in Emil's perception. His attention divided between the external performance of attentive colleague and the internal calculus of compensation. The wine he had consumed would require correction—walking, perhaps, later that evening, regardless of the rain.

Professor Weber's voice reached Emil intermittently as he described neural degeneration in a patient with an unusual occupational history. Emil registered fragments only—"progressive paralysis," "retained sensory function," "unusual preservation of memory"—while his mind drifted to the leather-bound notebook in his desk drawer, its entries organized by date, weight, intake, and expenditure.

"Dr. Králik."

The sound of his name restored his focus to the room. Professor Weber regarded him with professional expectation, the moment of contribution having arrived. Emil raised his wine glass with deliberate steadiness, an action that bought him several seconds for composition of thought.

"Yes," he responded, his voice modulated to the proper pitch of clinical authority. "I observed a case some years ago with particularly instructive documentation aspects. Male, early thirties, academic background, presenting initially with symptoms consistent with nervous exhaustion."

The leather armchair emitted a slight creak as he adjusted his position to the formal posture required of faculty. His colleagues arranged themselves in the attitudes of professional attention, a tableau of scientific observation.

"The subject exhibited unusual commitment to self-documentation," Emil continued. "He maintained records of his condition with a degree of clinical detachment one rarely encounters outside formal medical training."

He permitted himself the smallest possible contact with the wine before proceeding. "His documentation followed laboratory protocols in precision. Nutritional intake measured by volume—primarily clear broths in carefully restricted quantities. Physical activity recorded in regular increments with corresponding physiological effects: tremors manifesting after several hours of continuous ambulation, vertiginous episodes when the activity extended further, followed by what the subject described as 'a sensation of corporeal transcendence' in the final hour."

The room had assumed the quality of an anatomy theater. His colleagues' attention focused with the intensity found in dissection demonstrations, that particular scientific hunger that transforms a body into a text to be read.

"The most significant aspect was the subject's elaborate system of rationalization regarding his physical deterioration. Despite maintaining weight records with unusual precision—noting each reduction with evident satisfaction—he categorically rejected correlation between his diminished physical capacity and his systematic restriction of nourishment. Weakness was attributed to intellectual exertion; tremors were catalogued as evidence of nervous refinement; progressive emaciation was documented as an optimization of intellectual efficiency."

Professor Weber's notebook lay open on his knee, his pencil making the careful notations of a pathologist recording significant observations. The clock marked quarter past nine with mechanical indifference.

"The case resolved through institutional intervention. The subject was remanded to a medical facility until sufficient physical restoration enabled return to professional responsibilities." Emil placed his wine glass on the side table with careful precision. "His documentation proved valuable to understanding the cognitive architecture of such conditions, particularly the systematic nature of self-deception."

Silence expanded to fill the drawing room, broken only by the rhythm of rain against glass and the occasional adjustment of colleague against leather. Professional curiosity pressed against the constraints of social propriety.

"Most illuminating," Professor Weber said finally. "The documentation methods—you retain access to these records?"

"They demonstrate unusual thoroughness," Emil replied, professional distance maintained with care. "Confidentiality prevents specific disclosure, naturally, but the methodological approach warrants attention. Daily entries adhered to consistent format: 'Morning nutrition declined—lecture preparation requires optimal mental clarity. Midday sustenance unnecessary—research efficiency at peak levels. Evening walk extended to several hours—essential for cerebral circulation. Current physical measurements optimal for intellectual function.'"

His colleagues absorbed this information with expressions of professional interest rather than personal concern. None appeared to register the slight tremor in his right hand as he retrieved his wine glass, nor the calculations occurring behind his attentive expression.

As the next presentation commenced, Emil withdrew into the private arithmetic of his internal ledger. The rain continued its steady percussion against the windowpanes. In their gilt frames, the former chairs of medicine observed with the detached interest of researchers noting the progress of an experimental subject.

The faculty drawing room continued its function as a theater of medical observation, while outside, night pressed against the windows with the dark weight of scientific certainty.
