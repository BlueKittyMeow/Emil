# Faculty Drawing Room Scene - Draft

## Version 1

The rain made specimen slides of the windowpanes, each droplet distorting the lamplight into something clinical and strange. Emil watched the patterns from his position by the far wall, where the leather of his armchair creaked with each slight adjustment of his posture. His wine glass, barely touched, caught the light like a jar of preservative, its contents swimming thick and red.

The faculty drawing room bore its usual evening transformation: lamp-lit and tobacco-hazed, its familiar daytime austerity softening into something more intimate. Distinguished colleagues, their forms made indistinct by shadow, circled like medical students around their subjects – tonight's topic of discussion being unusual cases encountered in their practices. Their voices rose and fell in the dimness, each man scrabbling against the others like specimens jostling in a collection jar.

From the walls, portraits of past faculty members seemed to lean forward in their frames, their painted eyes holding the same keen interest Emil recognized from anatomy theaters. He took another measured sip of wine, letting the liquid rest on his tongue. In vino veritas, and like blood, it would reveal its secrets under proper analysis.

Dr. Hoffman was describing a case of particular fascination to the assembled company. "The patient presented initially with complaints of chest pain and difficulty breathing," he explained, gesturing with his cigar. "A laborer, thirty-six years of age, previously in robust health. Upon examination, we discovered an extraordinary calcification of the thoracic cavity."

The smoke from his cigar drew anatomical patterns in the air as he continued. "The fascinating aspect was the progression – the calcification spread in a pattern resembling tree branches, visible even through the skin. We documented its growth over several months, tracking its advance through the thoracic space." He paused to sip his brandy. "The specimen – that is to say, the patient – maintained remarkable lucidity throughout, enabling us to record his sensations as the condition progressed."

Emil noted the slip between "specimen" and "patient" with clinical detachment, recognizing how easily medical fascination could transform a person into an object of study. He had seen it countless times in the anatomy theater, that moment when human suffering became scientific observation.

A servant moved silently around the circle, offering to replenish wine glasses. Emil gave a slight shake of his head when the man reached him, covering his glass with long fingers. The wine's weight in his stomach was already more than he preferred.

Dr. Bartoš cleared his throat, drawing attention. "Speaking of unusual progressions, I encountered a remarkable case last autumn. A young woman of good family, presenting with an inexplicable series of seizures. The fascinating aspect was their precise timing – they occurred only at sunset, lasting exactly twelve minutes."

He paused to tap his cigar ash. "We tracked the episodes for three months. Like clockwork, each day as the sun touched the horizon, the seizures would begin. The patient remained conscious throughout, able to describe sensations of music that no one else could hear. She claimed it was always the same melody, though she had no musical training and couldn't reproduce it."

"Most curious was the abrupt cessation of symptoms. On the winter solstice, the episodes simply stopped. No explanation, no gradual improvement. One day present, the next gone, leaving us with more questions than answers." He sat back, satisfied with the murmurs of interest his case had provoked.

"And the patient's physical condition throughout?" Dr. Hoffman inquired, leaning forward. "Was there any deterioration?"

"Fascinating that you should ask," Dr. Bartoš replied. "Despite taking no sustenance during the episodes, she maintained her weight perfectly. Most unusual for a case of this duration. One might almost say her body preserved itself, as if in suspension."

Emil's wine glass froze halfway to his lips. The words "taking no sustenance" and "maintained her weight" echoed strangely in his ears, transforming from medical observation to personal accusation. He found himself calculating how many hours of walking it would take to counter the wine's weight in his stomach.

Through the haze of his thoughts, he was dimly aware of Professor Weber sharing his own case of nervous affliction, the words washing over him like the rain against the windows. His attention drifted, caught between the pressure of the wine in his stomach and the memory of his own carefully documented weight measurements, precise to the quarter-pound.

"And you, Dr. Králik?" Professor Weber's voice cut through Emil's contemplation. "Surely in your research on pain management, you must have encountered some unusual cases worth sharing?"

Emil felt the weight of their collective gaze shift toward him. He adjusted his position carefully, the leather creaking beneath him. His wine glass caught the light again as he raised it, using the motion to buy himself a moment's consideration.

"Yes," he said finally, his voice pitched to carry just far enough. "I had a rather interesting case some years ago. A young man, highly educated, presenting with what appeared initially to be simple nervous exhaustion."

He watched their interest sharpen, noting how they settled into their chairs. Even the rain seemed to pause in its pattering, as if to better hear his contribution.

"The patient exhibited progressive weakness, particularly in the extremities," Emil continued, his clinical tone perfect, practiced. "Initial examination suggested standard nervous debility, but the pattern of symptoms proved... unique."

Professor Weber's eyebrows lifted slightly. Several colleagues exchanged glances. Emil took another careful sip of wine, letting the anticipation build.

"The fascinating aspect was the patient's intellectual approach to his own condition. He maintained meticulous self-observation, documenting each progression with scientific precision. Rather than emotional deterioration, he demonstrated remarkable clinical detachment. One might say he became his own most dedicated research subject."

The rain resumed its steady rhythm against the windows, the droplets' shadows dancing across the carpet. Emil watched his colleagues' reactions through his wine glass, their features distorted by the red liquid.

"The patient reported sensations of lightness, 
almost weightlessness, during periods of 
intense study. Rather than finding this 
disturbing, he appeared to view it as a 
form of... transcendence."
"His documentation was extraordinarily precise. Daily logs recorded exact quantities of sustenance – often mere spoonfuls of clear broth, measured to the milliliter. Distance walked was calculated to the quarter-hour, with notations of physical effects: trembling after three hours, light-headedness at four, a curious floating sensation by the fifth hour."

He noted how they leaned forward now, their professional interest caught by this detail. The portraits on the walls seemed to lean in as well, their painted eyes reflecting the lamplight like specimen jars.

"Most intriguing was his adamant refusal to acknowledge the connection between his declining physical state and his systematic denial of sustenance. When confronted with his documented weight – which he recorded with obsessive precision, noting with satisfaction each fraction lost – he would present elaborate justifications. Temporary physical weakness was attributed to overwork, lightheadedness to excessive study, trembling hands to nervous exhaustion."

Professor Weber's hand had strayed to his notebook, his fingers twitching with the urge to document. Emil suppressed a smile, keeping his tone clinically detached.

"The case resolved eventually, of course. The patient was placed in a recovery facility until such time as he was physically competent, at which point he resumed his studies." Emil set his wine glass down with careful precision. "What made the case particularly instructive was the patient's ability to maintain scientific objectivity throughout. His documentation proved invaluable to understanding the progression of such conditions."

The room had grown very still, the only movement the steady tracking of raindrops down the windowpanes and the drift of tobacco smoke toward the ceiling. Emil could feel their professional curiosity, their desire to ask for more details warring with social propriety.

"Fascinating," Professor Weber said finally, breaking the silence. "And you have access to the patient's documentation?"

"The notes were quite extensive," Emil replied, his voice neutral. "Though patient confidentiality, of course, limits what can be shared. His daily logs were remarkably thorough – precise measurements of food refused, hours walked, weight lost, all recorded with the detachment of a scientist observing a specimen. Even his justifications were documented with clinical precision: 'Declined lunch due to critical experiment requiring steady hands. Afternoon walk extended to five hours – necessary for mental clarity. Current weight satisfactory for maintaining professional efficiency.'"

He watched them absorb this, noting how they began to shift in their chairs, minds already moving toward their own contributions. None of them seemed to notice how his fingers trembled slightly as he reached for his wine glass, or how the leather of his chair creaked under his carefully maintained posture.

The rain continued its steady slide down the windowpanes, each droplet containing its own distorted reflection of the room. Emil watched through his wine glass as the next colleague began his contribution, the vitreous turning the scene into something preserved, analyzed, safely contained behind glass.

In the portrait frames, the painted eyes of past faculty members continued their observation, their gazes holding the same clinical interest Emil had felt in anatomy theaters. He wondered, briefly, how many of them had carried their own carefully documented cases, their own specimens preserved in memory rather than spirits.

The evening continued its usual pattern, each contribution circling like medical students around their subject, while outside the rain made specimens of them all.
