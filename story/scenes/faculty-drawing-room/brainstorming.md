# Faculty Drawing Room Scene - Brainstorming

## Random Ideas & Questions
- What if the rain on windows creates shadow patterns that remind Emil of microscope slides?
- Could the wine in his glass look like a medical specimen?
- Are there portraits of past faculty members watching? How does Emil feel about their gaze?
- What medical cases would be "safe" for others to discuss vs triggering for Emil?
- Does someone accidentally touch him during the scene?

## Sensory Details to Play With
- Sound of rain vs sound of voices
- Warmth of fire vs cold windows
- Tobacco smoke patterns
- Quality of lamplight on different surfaces
- Weight of clothing, especially collar
- Taste/temperature of wine
- Feeling of chair fabric
- Smell of wet wool coats
- Increasing feeling of claustrophobia as the scene progresses

## Character Questions
- Who is Emil closest to physically in the room? Furthest from? Why?
- What small physical habits does he have when anxious?
- How does he hold his wine glass differently than others?
- What do his colleagues actually think of him?
- Who might notice something off about his "case"?
- Joccular characters who muddle through the rainy dimness like men swimming in a stream, the rising of one would denote the sinking of another. They scrabbled stories against one another trying to crest above the surface. 

## Symbolic Elements to Consider
- Rain as concealment/revelation
- Windows as barriers/mirrors
<!--- Wine as blood/specimen
- Lamplight as truth/deception
- Circle of colleagues as medical theater - ABSOLUTELY THIS. While they are colleagues, there is also a sense of one-upmanship and competition. Occasional reduction of the patients to pure pathology. 
- Faculty portraits as judgment
- Drawing room as dissection theater -->

## Possible Complications
- What if someone recognizes elements of his "case"?
- Could there be a physical reaction he can't hide?
- What if someone asks a too-pointed follow-up question?
- Maybe someone connects it to a similar case they know?

## Technical Elements to Research
- Types of wine served in faculty rooms
- Medical case presentation formats of the era
- Faculty room furniture typical in Prague universities
- Common medical terminology in German/Czech
- Academic hierarchy signals in seating/positioning

## Narrative Devices to Try
- Contrast between external dialogue and internal monologue
- Use of medical terminology to distance from personal - Definitely.
- Weather/atmosphere as emotional mirror
- Physical objects as metaphors
- Time dilation during his presentation

## Random Lines/Fragments
[Not final prose, just ideas to play with]
- "The raindrops flung their shadows on the wall, making specimen slides of the windowpanes"
<!--- "Their voices circled like medical students around a subject" -->
- "In the lamplight, the viscous wine swam like blood coagulating in a glass. In Vino Veritas, and just like blood it would reveal its secrets."
- "The portraits of past faculty seemed to lean forward, listening"
