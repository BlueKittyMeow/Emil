# Faculty Drawing Room Scene - Draft

## Version 2

The windowpanes wept with autumn rain, each droplet catching and fracturing the lamplight. Emil observed the patterns from his position in the leather armchair near the bookshelves, deliberately removed from the main circle of colleagues. His wine glass, more prop than refreshment, rested on the side table beside him, barely touched since it had been poured.

The faculty drawing room had undergone its nightly transformation. By day, it served as a stark, formal meeting space; by evening, with lamps lowered and fire lit, it became something more confessional—a place where scientific detachment softened just enough for stories to emerge. Tonight's ritual: unusual case studies from private practice, each man contributing his most fascinating specimen to the collective cabinet of curiosities.

The portraits of former department heads stared down from gilt frames, their severe expressions a reminder of the standards to which they all aspired. Emil felt their painted gazes following him as he shifted slightly, the leather creaking beneath him—a sound that seemed unnaturally loud in the momentary lull of conversation.

Dr. Hoffman adjusted his spectacles, gesturing with his cigar as he concluded his description. "The calcification progressed in a most remarkable manner—visible branches extending through the thoracic cavity. We were fortunate to document the progression over seventeen weeks."

"And the outcome?" someone asked from the shadow-filled corner.

"Educational," Hoffman replied, taking a sip of brandy. "The patient himself—or perhaps I should say the specimen—provided invaluable observations until the final stages."

Several colleagues nodded appreciatively at this contribution. Emil noted the fluidity with which Hoffman transitioned between "patient" and "specimen," a linguistic sleight of hand they all practiced to maintain professional distance. He had performed it himself countless times in lecture halls and journal articles.

"More wine, doctor?" The servant had materialized beside Emil's chair, decanter poised.

"No, thank you." Emil covered his glass with long fingers, feeling the cool crystal beneath his skin. The servant moved on, a silent shadow circulating between the islands of conversation.

Dr. Bartoš cleared his throat. "If we're discussing unusual progressions," he began, "I documented a case last autumn of particular chronological interest. A young woman with seizures occurring exclusively at sunset—precise to within minutes of the sun touching the horizon."

"Duration?" asked Dr. Weber.

"Exactly twelve minutes. Never varying." Bartoš tapped his cigar ash deliberately. "But the remarkable element was her consciousness throughout. She reported hearing music—always the same composition—though she had no musical training whatsoever."

A murmur of interest moved through the room. Emil found himself watching the smoke patterns from their cigars, how they formed anatomical shapes in the air—lungs, brains, spiraling nervous systems disintegrating into nothing.

"Most interestingly," Bartoš continued, "the condition resolved completely on the winter solstice. No progression, no diminishment—simply present one day, gone the next."

"The physical condition of the patient during these episodes?" Dr. Hoffman inquired, professional rivalry evident in the precision of his question.

"Most remarkable," Bartoš replied with evident satisfaction. "Despite her inability to take nourishment during the episodes, she maintained her weight perfectly throughout. As if preserved in amber, one might say. Not a pound lost over three months."

The room blurred slightly at the edges of Emil's vision. He found himself suddenly calculating—how many hours of walking to compensate for the three sips of wine he had consumed? The familiar arithmetic clicked into place, a defensive mechanism more automatic than breathing. Three sips, approximately 30 milliliters, primarily water but with sugar content, perhaps 25 calories total. One hour of brisk walking at minimum.

The conversation continued around him, Professor Weber now describing some case involving nerve damage, but Emil heard only fragments. His concentration had fractured, splitting between the present moment and his own meticulous records—the notebook hidden in his desk drawer, each day's entries precisely measured in ounces lost, hours walked, food declined.

"Dr. Králik." His name penetrated the haze. "You've been notably quiet. Surely your research has yielded some case worth sharing?"

Emil looked up to find Professor Weber regarding him with expectation. The room had fallen silent, all eyes turned toward him. He lifted his wine glass, a deliberate motion that bought him precious seconds to compose his thoughts.

"Yes," he said, his voice clinically detached. "I observed a case some years ago that might interest you. A young academic presenting with progressive weakness and what appeared initially to be nervous exhaustion."

The leather creaked beneath him as he adjusted his position, finding the formal posture expected of faculty. His colleagues shifted subtly, settling in for his contribution. Even the rain seemed to pause against the windows.

"The notable aspect was the patient's scientific approach to his own decline," Emil continued. "He maintained extensive documentation of his condition—a level of clinical detachment one rarely sees outside our profession."

He paused, took the smallest possible sip of wine, and continued. "His records were extraordinarily precise. Food consumed was measured to the milliliter—typically clear broth, no more than a few spoonfuls daily. Physical activity was documented in quarter-hour increments, with corresponding physical effects noted: trembling at three hours of continuous walking, vertigo at four, what he described as a 'transcendent lightness' by the fifth hour."

The room had grown still. Even the usual shifting and cigar-tapping had ceased. Emil could feel the weight of their professional interest, the clinical hunger that mirrored what he had seen in anatomy theaters.

"The most fascinating element was his insistence that his physical deterioration had no connection to his systematic refusal of nourishment. Despite documenting his weight with obsessive precision—recording each fraction of a pound lost with evident satisfaction—he maintained elaborate justifications. Physical weakness was attributed to intellectual exertion; tremors were evidence of nervous sensitivity; his continued weight loss was framed as an optimization of efficiency."

Professor Weber had begun taking notes, his pencil moving rapidly across his small leather notebook. Emil continued, maintaining the perfect clinical tone he had practiced over years of lectures.

"The patient was eventually placed in a recovery facility until he regained sufficient physical competence to resume his professional duties." Emil set his wine glass down with precision. "His extensive self-documentation proved invaluable to understanding the progression of such conditions, particularly the cognitive aspects of denial."

Silence hung in the air, broken only by the patter of rain against the windowpanes and the occasional creak of leather as someone shifted position. Emil could feel their interest, their professional curiosity warring with social constraints.

"Most remarkable," said Professor Weber finally. "This self-documentation—you still have access to these records?"

"They were exceptionally thorough," Emil replied, his voice betraying nothing. "Patient confidentiality prevents sharing specifics, of course, but the methodology was impressive. Daily entries followed a consistent format: 'Breakfast declined—morning lecture requires mental clarity. Lunch unnecessary—afternoon research proceeding well. Evening walk extended to four hours—essential for sleep quality. Current weight 121 pounds—optimal for intellectual function.'"

He watched his colleagues absorb this information, their expressions revealing professional fascination rather than personal concern. None appeared to notice how his hand trembled slightly as he reached again for his wine glass, or how he carefully calculated the remaining liquid, measuring it against the evening's necessary compensations.

As the next colleague began speaking, Emil retreated once more to his internal calculations. The rain continued its steady rhythm against the windows, creating patterns like slides under a microscope. In the portrait frames, the stern faces of his predecessors stared down, their painted eyes holding the same clinical interest he recognized from his own observations in the dissection theater.

The evening proceeded according to its usual pattern, cases presented and discussed with professional detachment, while outside the rain transformed the world into something categorized, examined, and preserved behind glass.
