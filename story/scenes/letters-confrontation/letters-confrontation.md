Extended Confrontation Scene
Felix's apartment, evening after Emil receives the most disturbing letter
The letter lay between them on Felix's desk, the paper innocuous against the polished wood. Felix had read it twice now, his expression shifting from confusion to disbelief to something Emil couldn't—or wouldn't—name.
"You've been receiving these for how long?" Felix's voice remained controlled, but the muscle in his jaw tensed visibly.
Emil stood by the window, arms folded across his chest. "The first arrived three weeks ago."
"Three weeks." Felix placed the letter on the table with precise movements, then opened his drawer and removed the others Emil had finally brought. He arranged them chronologically, creating a visual timeline of escalating obsession. "And you didn't think to mention them."
"They were clearly meant to frighten us away from the investigation."
"Us?" Felix looked up, his eyes catching Emil's reflection in the window. "Yet I'm only seeing them now."
Emil turned slightly, profile to the glass. "I saw no reason to cause unnecessary concern."
"Unnecessary?" Felix lifted one letter, the paper trembling almost imperceptibly in his grip. "'Your clavicles cast perfect shadows across your chest when you lecture.' This doesn't concern you?"
Emil's reflection in the glass remained perfectly composed. "The ravings of a disturbed mind."
"A disturbed mind who has been watching you. Following you." Felix spread the letters across the table with the care of an archivist. "Measuring you."
"Which is precisely why I didn't show you." Emil turned now, his back to the window. "I knew you would overreact."
"Overreact?" Something flashed in Felix's eyes—a crack in his careful composure. He gestured to the most recent letter. "He was in your bedroom, Emil. While you slept."
"A claim intended to frighten—"
"He quoted from your notebook." Felix's voice had dropped dangerously. "The one you keep locked in your desk drawer."
A momentary falter in Emil's expression confirmed what Felix had already deduced. The notebook existed.
"This has gone far beyond threats about the investigation." Felix stood, approaching Emil but stopping short of touching him. "This person sees you as a... specimen."
"Which is absurd." Emil's carefully maintained facade cracked slightly. "I'm not—"
"Not what?" Felix's voice softened, more dangerous in its gentleness than any shout. "Not thin enough? Not disciplined enough? Not far enough along in your transformation to qualify for his collection?"
Emil turned away, but Felix moved to block his retreat.
"He sees what I see, Emil." The words emerged with painful precision. "What everyone sees but you refuse to acknowledge."
The silence between them expanded, filled with years of unspoken observations and careful avoidances. Emil's throat worked visibly, swallowing words that refused to form.
"We need to take these to the authorities," Felix finally said.
"And tell them what?" Emil's voice held a bitter edge. "That I'm being stalked by the mysterious associate of a dead collector? That he finds my physical condition fascinating?" His hand gestured sharply toward his own body, a rare acknowledgment of its existence. "They'll be far more interested in why he finds me worth observing than in finding him."
Felix's eyes never left Emil's face. "Then we find him ourselves. But we do it together." He gathered the letters with methodical precision, his movements too controlled, too measured. Only the whiteness of his knuckles betrayed the rage beneath the surface. "No more secrets."
"You don't understand what's at stake." Emil's voice had thinned, professional authority failing him.
"I understand perfectly." Felix carefully placed the letters in a folder. "He's not the first to document your disappearance, Emil."
Emil's head snapped up, eyes widening fractionally.
Felix continued, each word placed with devastating care. "The difference is that I never intended to add you to a collection."
"I am not disappearing," Emil said, the denial automatic, rehearsed.
Felix crossed to his portfolio, removed a sketch, and placed it on the desk beside the letters. "This is from our university days, before your... absence." Another sketch joined it. "This is from last week."
The visual evidence lay between them, more damning than any letter. The transformation documented in Felix's precise lines was undeniable—the hollow cheeks, the sharpened angles, the spaces where there had once been substance.
"He sees you," Felix said quietly. "So do I. I always have."
Emil stared at the sketches, his clinical detachment failing him. "You've been documenting me."
"Yes."
"All this time."
"Yes."
Something shifted in Emil's expression—not anger, but a more complex emotion. "Why?"
Felix met his gaze directly. "For the same reason you document yourself. To bear witness."
Emil's hand moved toward the earlier sketch, hovering over it without touching. "I was different then."
"You were Emil then. You are Emil now." Felix's voice softened. "The proportions change. The person remains."
Emil withdrew his hand as if burned. "I need to review my lecture notes." The retreat to professional distance was desperate, transparent.
"Emil." Felix didn't move closer, but his voice crossed the distance between them. "He was in your rooms. While you slept. This isn't an academic matter anymore."
A tremor passed through Emil's right hand. He noted it clinically, cataloged it, filed it away. "Then what do you suggest?"
"You stay here tonight." Felix said it simply, as if suggesting the most natural thing in the world. "The spare room is prepared."
Emil's automatic refusal died on his lips as an unwelcome image flashed in his mind—waking to find the "colleague" measuring his sleeping form. "One night," he conceded. "Until we determine a more permanent solution."
Felix nodded, accepting this small victory. "I'll prepare tea."
As Felix moved toward the kitchen, Emil remained by the window, his reflection fractured by the evening light. The sketches remained on the desk—visual documentation of a transformation he had orchestrated but never truly seen from outside himself.
"He sees me," Emil whispered to the glass.
The reflection offered no response, only the sharpened angles of a face he both recognized and refused to claim as his own.

Felix returned with tea, setting the cups down with measured care. "It's Saturday tomorrow," he said, as if this were a normal conversation. "You have the Hoffman lecture in the morning?"
Emil nodded, accepting the tea. "Until eleven. And you?"
"Meeting with the preservation committee at nine, finished by ten." Felix sipped his tea. "We can collect your things afterward."
"That's unnecessary," Emil replied. "I can return to my rooms tonight."
"No." The single word carried unusual weight from Felix, who typically couched his concerns in gentler terms. "I'm not letting you out of my sight, Emil."
Something flickered in Emil's expression—not annoyance, as Felix expected, but genuine alarm. Felix watched the rapid calculation happening behind Emil's eyes.
"My evening walk," Emil said finally. The words emerged reluctantly, an admission of habit he normally concealed.
"Your evening walk," Felix repeated, understanding dawning. Emil's nightly disappearances, often lasting hours. The walks Emil never mentioned but Felix had occasionally observed. "If you need to continue your haunting of the city at night, I will accompany you."
Something twisted in Emil's expression. "That would be too much exertion for you. It could make you ill."
Or thinner than you are, a dark part of his mind whispered. Emil pushed the thought away, disturbed by its emergence.
"I assure you, I can match your pace," Felix said, misinterpreting Emil's concern.
Emil acquiesced with unusual quickness. "Very well. You may accompany me tomorrow to collect my possessions."
Felix hesitated, then decided to press his momentary advantage. "All your possessions? Including the scale behind your dressing screen?"
The teacup in Emil's hand stilled halfway to his lips. Not a guess, then. Felix had known.
"It's university property," Emil said, the lie transparent to both of them.
A silence extended between them, filled with years of unspoken knowledge.
"You'll need to sleep somewhere," Felix said finally, setting his cup down. "You're welcome to share my bed. It's certainly large enough for two."
The offer was perfectly ordinary by conventional standards—male friends sharing accommodations was common practice—but Emil stiffened visibly.
"That won't be necessary," he said, his voice overly formal.
Felix nodded, unsurprised. "Then I'll prepare the study for you. The settee is surprisingly comfortable—I've fallen asleep there often enough while working."
As Felix rose to arrange the study, Emil remained in his chair, hands wrapped around his cooling tea. The thought of sharing a bed with Felix produced a complex cascade of emotions he had no interest in examining. The professional distance between them was necessary, particularly given his current vulnerability.
He followed Felix to the doorway of the study several minutes later, watching as Felix efficiently cleared architectural drawings from a comfortable-looking settee along the wall. The room was tidy and methodical, much like Felix himself.
"I can sleep in the chair," Emil offered. "There's no need to disrupt your work space."
"It's no disruption," Felix replied, laying out a blanket and pillow. He moved to a wardrobe and removed a burgundy dressing gown. "For the morning. And you'll need a shirt for tomorrow—there's no sense in attending your lecture in a rumpled one."
He selected a white shirt from the wardrobe, setting it beside the dressing gown. "The washroom is across the hall, should you need it."
Emil nodded, the domestic intimacy of the situation creating an unfamiliar discomfort. "Thank you."
"You're welcome to borrow a nightshirt as well, though I often sleep in my underclothes when alone." Felix spoke casually, as if discussing the weather rather than sleeping habits.
Emil's mind produced an unwanted image of Felix in nothing but his drawers, the artistic frame he'd always envied exposed. He dismissed the thought immediately.
"This is sufficient," Emil replied stiffly.
Felix nodded, recognizing the boundaries being established. "Then I'll bid you goodnight. Should you need anything, my room is at the end of the hall."
After Felix withdrew, Emil remained standing in the study doorway for several long moments. Finally, he closed the door and began methodically removing his waistcoat and collar, folding each with precision and placing them on Felix's desk chair. He unlaced his shoes and set them beneath the chair, aligned perfectly.
The intimacy of disrobing in Felix's space felt oddly transgressive. Emil retained his trousers and shirt, loosening only the cuffs before settling onto the settee. Despite his exhaustion, sleep remained elusive, his mind circling through the events of the day. The letters. The sketches. The knowledge that someone had been in his rooms, had read his ledger, had watched him sleep.
More disturbing still was Felix's apparent knowledge—of the scale, of the ledger, perhaps of everything Emil had worked to conceal. Had Felix truly seen him all this time? Did his sketches capture what Emil had become, or did the artist's eye romanticize, softening the reality?
The thought followed Emil into uneasy dreams, where Felix's sketches became drawn and warped, the lines twisting and contorting, the angles becoming impossible.
When morning light filtered through the study windows, Emil rose, having achieved perhaps three hours of fitful rest. He reached for the dressing gown Felix had provided, pulling it on over his rumpled shirt and loosened trousers.
The garment enveloped him. Unlike a nightshirt, which was designed to hang loosely, a dressing gown was meant to wrap around the body with some definition. Felix's dressing gown, however, overlapped nearly twice around Emil's frame. The shoulders hung well past his own, creating an almost comical effect. The sleeves extended far beyond his hands, requiring substantial folding to free his fingers.
Emil reached for the belt, wrapping it around his waist. He pulled it tight, noting with clinical detachment that the belt could circle his waist twice completely and still leave excess to tie. 
He stood before the small mirror on Felix's bookshelf, the morning light harsh and unforgiving. The evidence was undeniable. The architectural drawings on Felix's desk suddenly caught his attention—precise measurements noted in Felix's careful hand. Felix dealt in accurate measurements professionally. He would not own a dressing gown so dramatically missized for his frame.
The logical conclusion was both simple and impossible: Felix was substantially larger than Emil.
He adjusted the garment, tightening the belt further, but the excess fabric remained evident. Emil's mind produced calculations automatically—shoulder width discrepancy of approximately seven centimeters, chest circumference difference of at least fifteen centimeters, waist measurement significantly greater.
These measurements contradicted everything in his ledger.
He was still standing there, hands hovering at the excess belt length, when Felix appeared at the study door, already dressed for the day except for his jacket.
"Did you sleep at all?" Felix asked, then paused, his eyes taking in Emil's appearance.
Emil looked up, uncharacteristic confusion evident in his expression. "Your dressing gown..."
"Yes?" Felix's voice was carefully neutral, but his eyes conveyed more as they moved from Emil's face down to where the belt cinched the excessive fabric around his waist, then back up to meet Emil's gaze.
"It's considerably too large." The statement emerged with clinical precision despite the personal implications.
Emil watched Felix's face, trying to read his expression. There was concern there, certainly, but something else—a flash of what might have been alarm quickly masked by professional composure. Felix was seeing him without the careful layers of professional attire, without the strategic tailoring that maintained appearances.
Felix's expression softened with understanding. "Yes, Emil. It is."
"I had thought—" Emil stopped, unable to articulate the fundamental error in his perception.
"I know what you thought," Felix said quietly. His eyes lingered again on the belt, drawn impossibly tight around Emil's waist, creating folds of excess fabric. For a moment, the professional distance between them wavered, Felix's concern visible without the usual careful concealment.
"Would you like coffee before your lecture?" Felix offered, restoring the normal rhythm of their interactions.
Emil nodded, grateful for the moment to compose himself. As Felix turned toward the kitchen, Emil called after him. "Felix?"
"Yes?"
"Is your tailor Herr Schmidt on Wenceslas Square?"
Felix paused. "No. Herr Müller on Nerudova Street. Why?"
"No reason," Emil replied, though both men understood the question's true purpose.






Emil followed Felix to the kitchen, the dressing gown dragging slightly on the floor behind him. His mind worked frantically to reconcile the physical evidence with his established self-perception.
Different tailoring standards. That was the logical explanation. Felix's tailor clearly cut generously, while Emil's preferred a more Continental fit. Or perhaps Felix had purchased the dressing gown when he was larger. A gift from a relative, even. The excess fabric didn't necessarily mean what it appeared to mean.
"The shirt should fit better than the dressing gown,"" Felix said, placing coffee and bread on the small kitchen table. "Though it will still be loose."


"Different tailors use different measurements," Emil replied, seizing on the explanation. "Your tailor appears to favor a more generous cut."
Felix paused in pouring the coffee, something flickering in his expression—recognition of the psychological mechanism at work. "Perhaps," he said neutrally, neither confirming nor challenging Emil's rationalization.

Emil nodded, his mind still processing the implications of the dressing gown. "I'm not particularly hungry this morning," he said automatically.
For once, Felix didn't maintain the pretense. "Eat the bread, Emil." It wasn't a suggestion.
Something in his tone prompted Emil to reach for a piece without the usual series of excuses. "I have lecture notes to review before class."
"They're at your apartment," Felix reminded him. "We'll collect them after our morning commitments."
Emil sipped his coffee, the familiar rhythm of negotiation and avoidance somehow comforting after the disorientation of the dressing gown revelation.
"About these letters," Felix said, his tone shifting to professional analysis. "The writer clearly has medical knowledge and access to various locations. That narrows our field considerably."
Emil seized the topic gratefully. "The handwriting is disguised, but certain letter formations suggest formal medical training. Note the way medical terms are written with particular precision."
They spent the remainder of breakfast discussing potential suspects, a neutral topic that restored the familiar dynamic between them. Yet whenever Emil moved, the excess fabric of the dressing gown rustled, a persistent reminder of the reality his mind had refused to acknowledge.


Later, as he buttoned Felix's shirt for the day's lecture, Emil confronted another piece of evidence. Even with the cuffs folded back and the collar loose, the garment hung from his frame like a sail without wind. The shoulders extended well past his own, the chest allowed for twice his circumference.
The shirt would be visible to colleagues beneath his jacket. Questions would arise. Explanations would be required.


Felix appeared at the washroom door as Emil struggled with the excess fabric. "Here," he said, offering a set of shirt pins. "These should help."
The simple act—Felix anticipating the problem, offering a practical solution—conveyed more than words could have. Felix had known exactly how the shirt would fit. He had seen Emil clearly all along.
"Thank you," Emil said, accepting the pins.
As he worked to adjust the shirt, creating artificial seams with the pins, Emil forced his mind to approach the situation with scientific detachment. His self-perception contained a significant error margin. His documentation was flawed. Recalibration would be required.

# The Morning After

*Prague streets, morning, Emil and Felix walking to the university*

The city awoke around them as they made their way toward the university, early merchants arranging their wares, servants beating carpets in courtyards, the familiar rhythm of Prague's morning. Emil walked at a deliberately brisk pace, Felix matching his stride without apparent effort.

Three streets from Felix's apartment, the bread began to sit heavily in Emil's stomach, an unfamiliar weight that drew his attention with increasing insistence. He had eaten mechanically, without his usual precise calculations or measured portions. The coffee, too—he had finished the entire cup, distracted by the dressing gown revelation and subsequent rationalizations.

He needed to document this deviation. Precision required complete records, even of errors.

Emil reached into his inner jacket pocket, retrieving the small leather notebook he always carried. Unlike the comprehensive ledger locked in his desk drawer, this portable version contained abbreviated notations—enough to transfer to the master record later. He withdrew the slender silver pencil attached to the cover.

"A moment," he said, stopping abruptly in the middle of the pavement.

Felix halted beside him, watching as Emil flipped to the current date and made quick, precise notations: *Bread (est. 120g), black coffee (full cup)*. He added the approximate time and closed the notebook with a decisive snap.

"You document everything you consume," Felix observed. Not a question, but a confirmation of something long suspected.

Emil returned the notebook to his pocket without responding. The morning had already featured too many revelations, too much vulnerability. He resumed walking, increasing his pace subtly.

"The university will not vanish if we arrive at a normal walking speed," Felix commented, though he matched Emil's quickened stride without difficulty.

"I prefer to have time to prepare before students arrive," Emil replied stiffly.

The intimacy of the previous night and morning had created an uncomfortable awareness between them. Emil had been seen—not just physically in the oversized dressing gown, but in the deeper sense of having his private rituals observed and acknowledged. The professional distance he maintained so carefully had been compromised.

They walked in silence for several blocks, the space between them charged with unspoken knowledge. Emil calculated the energy expenditure of their current pace, mentally adjusting for the bread's caloric content. Not enough. He would need to extend his evening walk significantly.

"I'm considering several possible identities for our letter writer," Felix said finally, breaking the silence. "The handwriting suggests medical training, as you noted, but the access to your rooms narrows the field considerably."

Emil seized on the topic gratefully, professional analysis replacing personal discomfort. "Whoever it is must have a connection to both Reichmann's collection and the university."

"I stayed awake watching your door last night," Felix said, the casual tone belying the significance of the statement. "No one attempted to enter."

Emil glanced at him sharply. "You didn't sleep?"

"I dozed in the chair for perhaps an hour toward dawn," Felix admitted. "But maintained watch most of the night."

Something twisted in Emil's chest—an uncomfortable awareness of Felix sacrificing rest for his safety, a debt of care he hadn't requested and couldn't easily repay.

"That was unnecessary," he said, the words sounding ungrateful even to his own ears.

"I disagree," Felix replied simply. "Someone has been entering your rooms while you sleep. That seems to necessitate precaution."

They approached the university gates, other faculty members and early students already moving through the courtyard. Emil automatically increased the distance between himself and Felix, a habitual adjustment when transitioning from private to public spaces.

"I'll meet you here at eleven-thirty," Felix said, understanding the unspoken boundary. "We can proceed to your apartment from there."

Emil nodded, already shifting into his professional demeanor. "I'll bring the letters. We should compare them with samples of faculty handwriting."

"Until then," Felix acknowledged, turning toward the architectural history building while Emil proceeded to the medical faculty.

As they separated, Emil was already planning his compensations for the bread. The morning lectures would consume approximately 250 calories through standard lecturing activities. Insufficient. He would need to take the stairs several times between classes, perhaps volunteer to rearrange the laboratory specimens for the afternoon demonstrations.

The bread sat in his stomach like an accusation, a reminder of his momentary weakness in Felix's kitchen. Such lapses in discipline could not be permitted, regardless of the revelations about dressing gowns and shirts.

He entered the lecture hall, arranging his notes with practiced precision. The morning's events had threatened the careful structure of his existence. He would restore order through documentation, calculation, and control.

Felix's shirt shifted against his skin as he prepared the demonstration materials, the excess fabric gathered and pinned at his back. Another reminder, another question he refused to acknowledge.

Different tailors. Different standards of measurement. The explanation remained perfectly logical, regardless of what Felix's eyes had conveyed when seeing him in the dressing gown.

Emil opened his lecture notes, forcing his attention to the material at hand. For the next three hours, he would be Dr. Králik, respected lecturer and researcher. All else—the letters, the dressing gown, the bread—would be carefully compartmentalized until he could properly address them in his ledger.

Control would be maintained. It must be.

*Later, as they meet at the university gates*

Felix waited at the appointed meeting place, his expression revealing nothing to casual observers. Only someone who knew him well would notice the subtle signs of fatigue—the slight tightness around his eyes, the barely perceptible decrease in his usual animated gestures.

Emil approached from the medical building, his professional mask firmly in place. To colleagues passing by, they appeared to be simply two faculty members meeting for lunch or professional discussion.

"Your lecture?" Felix inquired as they fell into step.

"Adequate," Emil replied. "Yours?"

"Productive. The committee approved the restoration funding." Felix maintained the casual conversation until they had passed through the university gates and were safely beyond faculty earshot. "You've taken the stairs eleven times since this morning."

Emil's step faltered momentarily. "You've been watching me."

"No more than usual," Felix replied. "I happened to be crossing the courtyard several times. You appeared quite determined."

The simple observation carried weight beyond its content—another acknowledgment of patterns Emil preferred to keep unrecognized.

"Exercise improves mental clarity," Emil said, the justification automatic.

Felix didn't challenge this, instead changing the subject. "I've been considering who might have keys to your rooms. The landlady, certainly. Perhaps a colleague whom you've given access for professional reasons?"

Emil considered this as they walked toward his apartment. "Dr. Weber has a key for emergencies. No one else that I'm aware of."

"Anyone who might have borrowed and copied your key temporarily? A servant who cleans your rooms?"

"I maintain my own quarters," Emil replied. "More efficient that way."

They continued their professional analysis of the letter writer's possible identity, the conversation providing comfortable distance from the morning's revelations. Yet beneath the discussion, both men remained acutely aware of what had transpired—the dressing gown, the shirt pins, the notebook entry, the night watch.

Too much had been seen. Too much acknowledged.

As they approached Emil's apartment building, a new tension emerged. Felix would now enter Emil's private space with full knowledge of what to look for—the scale, the ledger, the carefully constructed environment that maintained Emil's disciplines.

The vulnerability of this was almost unbearable, yet unavoidable if they were to address the threat of the letters. Emil's hand tightened around his keys as they reached his door.

Some boundaries, once crossed, could never be fully restored.

# The Apartment Visit & Confrontation

*Emil's apartment, midday*

Emil's  in the lock with precise familiarity. He paused imperceptibly before opening the door, a moment of reluctance before allowing Felix into this space. The apartment appeared undisturbed—exactly as Emil had left it the previous evening.

"I'll prepare a valise," Emil said, moving toward his bedroom with deliberate efficiency. "It shouldn't take long."

"I'll examine the locks while you pack," Felix replied, already moving toward the door frame with practiced scrutiny.

Emil nodded stiffly before retreating to his bedroom. Once alone, he moved to his desk with near-silent haste, unlocking the bottom drawer and retrieving the leather-bound ledger. This, above all else, needed to be secured. He wrapped it in a shirt before placing it in his valise, positioning it beneath other clothing.

His mind worked through calculations as he packed—the university scale could be accessed early mornings before staff arrived. The pharmacy on Karlova Street had a coin-operated weight machine in their back room. The public baths offered weighing services for a small fee. He could maintain his documentation without the convenience of his personal scale.

Through the partially closed door, Emil heard Felix's voice in the hallway—the distinct cadence of a question. His landlady's response carried more clearly. "...Dr. von Rothenberg. You've visited before."

Emil's hands stilled momentarily. Frau Novak was notoriously observant and equally talkative. He continued packing with increased urgency, straining to hear their exchange, but could discern only the murmur of continued conversation. 

The ledger safely hidden, Emil selected three shirts, his lecture notes, and necessary toiletries. He had left the scale, knowing it would be impossible to transport without explanation. As he closed the valise, he heard his landlady's voice rise briefly: "—cannot live on air and coffee, Dr. von Rothenberg."

A cold precision settled over his movements. Felix was inquiring about his personal habits—matters entirely outside the scope of their investigation. The violation registered as both professional and deeply personal.

By the time Emil emerged from the bedroom, valise in hand, Felix had returned to the sitting room, his expression thoughtful in a way that suggested new information acquired.

"The locks appear undisturbed," Felix reported. "Either our letter writer has exceptional skill, or they possess a key."

Emil nodded, his expression carefully neutral. "I've packed what I need for Monday's lectures. We should return to review the letters more carefully."

As they descended the stairs, Emil studied Felix's uncharacteristic silence, his usual conversational nature subdued. Whatever Frau Novak had shared had clearly affected him.

"Did you discover something else?" Emil asked, his tone maintaining professional detachment.

"Only confirmations," Felix replied ambiguously.

They walked in silence for several blocks, Emil's mind cataloging both the items in his valise and the potential damage of his landlady's observations. What precisely had she reported? How much had Felix extracted from her indiscreet tendency toward maternal concern?

Felix maintained his unusual quiet, his gaze focused ahead rather than on Emil as was his habit. The absence of his customary attention felt both relieving and strangely unsettling.

Only when they had returned to Felix's apartment and the door was safely closed did Emil confront him.

"What did you discuss with my landlady?" he asked, setting his valise carefully by the settee.

Felix hung his coat before answering. "I asked about unusual visitors to your rooms."

"And?" 

"She mentioned that Dr. Weber visits occasionally."

Emil's posture relaxed slightly. "As I told you, he has a key for emergencies. Professional courtesy."

Felix moved to the kitchen, filling the kettle. "She also mentioned your meals."

The words hung in the air between them. Emil's expression cooled perceptibly.

"My dietary habits are not relevant to identifying our letter writer," he said, his tone carrying a warning edge.

Felix turned to face him fully. "They are when the writer references your 'meticulous self-observation' and 'systematic restriction.'"

"That's hardly—"

"Coffee in the morning. Perhaps bread once a week," Felix said. "According to your landlady, who provides meals you pay for but barely touch."

Emil felt a flash of genuine anger break through his professional composure. "You had no right to question her about personal matters."

"I had every right," Felix replied, his own control slipping. "Someone is documenting your self-starvation with professional interest. Someone is entering your rooms while you sleep. These facts are connected."

"Lower your voice," Emil hissed. "The raving fanatic could be listening."

Felix gestured sharply toward his own apartment door. "Not here. My rooms are secure. And you're avoiding the central issue."

"Which is?"

"That you're killing yourself systematically, and someone finds it fascinating enough to document alongside you."

The blunt statement fell between them like a physical object, impossible to step around or ignore.

"My professional habits are not your concern," Emil said, his voice dangerously controlled.

"They ceased being merely professional when someone decided to add you to their collection," Felix countered. "Your ledger. Your scale. Your careful measurements. You've been creating the perfect documentation for someone else's specimen case."

Emil's hand tightened on the back of a chair. "That's absurd."

"Is it? 'The self-documenting subject whose transformation continues under observation,'" Felix quoted from the latest letter. "You're doing half their work for them, Emil."

"There is nothing to document," Emil responded, each word precisely measured. "I maintain a reasonable weight for my height and constitution. Any physician would confirm this assessment."

"Any physician would see exactly what I see," Felix retorted. "A colleague systematically reducing himself to a laboratory specimen."

"Your artistic imagination has always been excessive," Emil said coldly. "Not everything is a subject for your sketches or your analysis."

"This isn't about my sketches. This is about your survival."

The kettle began to whistle, the sound cutting through the tension between them. Felix turned to remove it from the heat.

"My survival," Emil said with measured precision, "is not in question. What is in question is your ability to maintain professional boundaries during this investigation."

Felix's back stiffened at the accusation. When he turned again, his expression had hardened. "Professional boundaries. Is that what Doktor Weber maintains when he visits your apartment with his key? Is he respecting professional boundaries when he observes your condition?"

"That's entirely different," Emil countered. "Doktor Weber is my departmental superior. His concern is institutional."

"And mine is what, exactly?" Felix challenged. "Merely artistic? An aesthetic interest in your disappearance?"

"Your concern," Emil said with clinical detachment, "while perhaps well-intentioned, is fundamentally misplaced. I am not ill. I am not a subject for examination or intervention. I am a colleague requesting assistance with a specific investigative matter."

Felix studied him for a long moment, something complicated moving behind his eyes. "And if I refuse to separate these matters? If I insist that your systematic self-reduction is precisely what has attracted this collector's attention?"

"Then I will thank you for your time and seek assistance elsewhere," Emil replied, his voice steady despite the anger thrumming beneath his control. "I did not come here to be diagnosed or treated. I came for your expertise in historical archives and documentation."

The silence stretched between them, filled with the quiet sound of Felix preparing tea that would likely remain untouched.

"Very well," Felix said finally, his voice returning to its measured tone. "For now, we will focus solely on identifying your observer. But this conversation is postponed, Emil, not concluded."

Emil recognized the professional compromise for what it was—a temporary truce rather than a surrender. His anger receded, replaced by the familiar, cool precision.

"Agreed," he said formally. "Now, shall we examine the handwriting in these letters more systematically?"

Felix nodded, bringing the tea service to his desk where the letters waited. But as they arranged the papers methodically, Emil noted that Felix's gaze returned to him more frequently than to the documents—studying, assessing, measuring in a way that felt uncomfortably similar to the unknown observer whose identity they sought.

The letters lay between them, but the true subject of investigation had shifted. Emil understood with perfect clarity that he was now being observed not by one but by two pairs of eyes, each with their own purpose, their own conclusions, their own threat to the autonomy he had constructed with such careful precision.

The wall clock marked seven-thirty as they concluded their preliminary analysis. Three hours of meticulous work had produced little beyond confirmation that the handwriting showed professional training—possibly medical or scientific—and the paper was of common but good quality.
Felix had removed his jacket two hours earlier, rolled up his shirtsleeves, and loosened his collar. Emil remained fully dressed, his frock coat buttoned, his collar precise despite the warmth of the apartment. The contrast between them marked more than mere habit.
Emil rose and began to pace the length of Felix's sitting room, his steps measured and controlled. The familiar tension built within him—the need for movement, for the precise calculation of streets and distances that structured his evenings. His ritual two-hour walk should have begun thirty minutes ago. The disruption to his schedule felt like sand beneath his skin, irritating and impossible to ignore.
Felix looked up from the letters, observing Emil's movement with quiet attention.
"You usually walk at this hour," he said. Not a question.
Emil stopped mid-stride, his posture stiffening slightly. "I find evening exercise conducive to mental clarity."
"It occurs to me," Felix said, arranging the letters into a neat stack, "that recreating your usual walking pattern might yield valuable information. Your observer likely knows your habits. We might detect someone following or watching along your customary route."
The tension in Emil's shoulders eased fractionally. "A reasonable investigative approach," he agreed, relief carefully masked.
"I should eat something first," Felix said, rising and moving toward his small kitchen. "Investigating on an empty stomach is poor strategy."
He returned with bread, cheese, and cold sliced ham arranged on a plate. Setting it on the table between them, he added a second empty plate.
"Please, help yourself if you'd like," he said, the invitation casual, without emphasis. "I can prepare coffee as well."
"Coffee would be appreciated," Emil replied, taking a precise step back from the food. "I rarely eat this late."
Felix nodded without comment and returned to the kitchen. Emil observed how carefully his host avoided any hint of pressure or judgment—a strategic restraint that somehow felt more intrusive than direct confrontation would have been.
While Felix ate with efficient haste, Emil sipped his coffee, holding the cup with measured precision. The liquid was bitter and black, exactly as he preferred, providing stimulation without substance.
"Ready?" Felix asked, leaving half the food untouched as he rose. A deliberate choice, perhaps, to avoid drawing attention to their different approaches to nourishment.
They departed into the evening air. Emil set a pace that balanced efficiency with the need to observe their surroundings, his body finally allowed its required motion. The route was so familiar he could have walked it blindfolded—each turn calculated, each street measured in precise number of steps.
As they walked, Emil's mind turned inward despite his vigilance. The bread Felix had set out—had he noticed Emil's momentary glance at it? Would he interpret that glance as hunger or interest? Emil knew with clinical certainty that the small piece he might have consumed would have been reasonable, even necessary. Yet the thought of Felix observing this consumption, perhaps making notes of his own, was intolerable.
More disturbing was Felix's careful neutrality. He had not insisted Emil eat, had not commented on his refusal. Perhaps he too believed Emil required nothing. Perhaps he saw the same optimal efficiency that Emil himself cultivated. Or worse—perhaps he had already determined Emil beyond help and not worth the effort of persuasion.
"Emil," Felix's voice broke through his spiraling thoughts. "Isn't that Dr. Weber ahead?"
Emil looked up, his attention suddenly external again. At the junction ahead stood the familiar figure of his departmental superior, engaged in conversation with another academic.
"Yes," Emil confirmed. "We often nearly cross paths. He lives three streets beyond the university."
"Do you usually speak with him during your walks?"
"No," Emil said, already turning toward a side street before Weber could notice them. "I generally take this route to avoid unnecessary social obligations."
Felix followed him down the narrower street, which paralleled their original path. "Have you noticed anyone else who regularly appears along your routes? Anyone who seems to observe your movements?"
Emil considered this with renewed clinical focus, grateful for the return to their investigative purpose. "Not specifically. Though one develops a certain awareness of being observed."
"In what way?"
"The feeling of eyes following your movements," Emil said, his pace precise and measured. "The sense of being assessed rather than merely seen."
Felix nodded. "Like being measured rather than regarded."
"Precisely."
"How long have you had this sensation?"
Emil hesitated, calculating. "Three months, perhaps. Though it's become more pronounced recently."
"Coinciding with the first letter," Felix noted.
"Yes," Emil agreed. "Though I attributed it initially to professional scrutiny. One is always observed in university settings."
"By colleagues like Weber."
"Among others."
They continued in silence for several blocks, each cataloging their surroundings with professional attention. Emil felt his thoughts clearing with the physical exertion, the rhythm of movement restoring his equilibrium. Despite the deviation from his usual solitary routine, the walk was serving its essential purpose.
"Does Weber know about your walking patterns?" Felix asked suddenly.
Emil considered this. "He's commented on them occasionally. He once suggested I might benefit from 'more rest and less perambulation.'"
"And yet he possesses a key to your rooms."
"As I explained, a professional courtesy."
"Professional concern, perhaps," Felix suggested, his tone neutral but pointed.
Emil stopped at the corner where their path would turn back toward Felix's apartment. "What precisely are you implying?"
"Only that Dr. Weber seems particularly interested in your habits. Both professional and personal."
"As my departmental chair, his interest is appropriate."
"And your observer? Is their interest appropriate as well?"
Emil's posture stiffened. "Hardly comparable."
"Both watch you. Both document. Both maintain a professional distance while cataloging your transformation." Felix's voice remained measured, but the observation cut sharp.
"We agreed to postpone this discussion," Emil reminded him coldly.
"So we did," Felix conceded. "My apologies."
They resumed walking in silence, the distance between them measured in more than physical space. The evening air carried a chill that seemed to penetrate Emil's layers of clothing with unusual efficiency, reminding him of his increasing sensitivity to cold.
As they approached Felix's building, Emil found himself calculating the calories expended during their abbreviated walk—perhaps 150, rather than his usual 320. The deficit would require adjustment. Perhaps an extended period of standing during tomorrow's lecture preparation would compensate.
The precision of these thoughts brought momentary comfort, a return to the ordered systems that structured his existence. Yet beneath this familiar ritual lay the disquieting awareness that such calculations now had an audience—not only the unknown observer whose letters had revealed their watching, but Felix as well, whose artistic eye missed nothing and whose silence spoke volumes.
The true threat, Emil realized as they climbed the stairs to Felix's apartment, was not merely being observed, but being understood. In their different ways, both Felix and their unknown letter writer had glimpsed the architecture of his carefully constructed control. And neither, it seemed, would be content simply to watch its continued construction—or its inevitable collapse.
