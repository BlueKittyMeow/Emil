"This discussion is concluded," Emil continued, his voice carrying the clinical authority that had cowed students and colleagues alike. "I am not your patient, Felix. I am not in need of intervention."
Felix's hand dropped from the bell pull, but his expression remained resolute. "Emil, I suspect you haven't eaten properly in days. You just lost the only substantial meal you've attempted in perhaps weeks. Eating is not optionalâ€”it's necessary."
Emil's eyes blazed with sudden fury, and something in him snapped like a wire pulled too tight.
"Necessary? No one even knows what necessary looks like. It is only necessary if I SAY it is necessary. If I want to walk for six hours and I feel fatigued at four, I will still manage to walk for six if I deem it necessary. If my hands start to shake I will still their shaking with proper chemicals because they shall not shake unless I deem it necessary. If I decide to fast for two weeks then fast I shall if I deem it necessary. There is no NECESSARY when it comes to the irritating, incessant, infuriating demands of the body, there is only what I and I alone deem necessary."
Emil stilled abruptly, all of the fury burned out of him like a slip of paper filled with written sins, incinerated and leaving only ash. The moment stretched out between himself and Felix in the flickering firelight.
Felix closed his eyes, and Emil told himself it was a flicker of the light and not a tear that seemed to appear at the corner of one eye. When Felix opened his eyes again, he held his hands out as if not to startle the delicate wild creature he had found occupying his drawing room, and slowly stepped toward Emil.
He gently placed his hands on Emil's upper arms and slowly guided them down. Emil let himself be lowered to the settee, Felix coming to kneel before him.
"There is too much affection between us for this to be how it goes," Felix said quietly, looking up at him like a penitent, a pilgrim supplicating for intercession from some saint. "Please. Can we try this again, some other way?"
Emil felt all of the worthless bones in his body, pieces that would never belong in a reliquary, and he slid down to join Felix on the floor, on his knees.

Neither of them could say afterwards which of them began the prayer, perhaps they began together, a moment of divine discontent.
"Pater noster qui es in caelis, sanctificetur nomen tuum."
Their voices found each other in the familiar Latin, Felix's steady baritone blending with Emil's quieter tones. The fire crackled softly behind them, casting their shadows long across the Persian carpet.
"Adveniat regnum tuum. Fiat voluntas tua, sicut in caelo et in terra."
Emil's voice caught slightly on fiat voluntas tua - thy will be done - the words heavy with the weight of submission he had spent so long rejecting. Felix's hand found his, fingers intertwining with surprising warmth.
"Panem nostrum quotidianum da nobis hodie..."
Give us this day our daily bread. The words hung in the air between them, laden with meaning that had nothing to do with ordinary hunger and everything to do with the sustenance Emil had been denying himself, the nourishment of body and soul he had systematically rejected.
"Et dimitte nobis debita nostra, sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris."
Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. Both men's voices grew quieter, as if the weight of what they sought forgiveness for - the lies, the self-destruction, the love they dared not name - might be too much for even these ancient words to bear.
"Et ne nos inducas in tentationem, sed libera nos a malo. Amen."
Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
In the silence that followed, neither moved to make the sign of the cross. They remained kneeling, hands clasped, in the presence of something larger than either of them could face alone.
