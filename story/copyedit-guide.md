# Copyediting Guide for Victorian Medical Gothic Style

## Core Principles

### 1. Precision vs. Mechanicality
- Maintain clinical precision while avoiding machine-like rigidity
- Use exact measurements only when they serve character or plot
- Allow some natural variation in formal patterns
- Keep technical accuracy without overwhelming detail

### 2. Language Efficiency
- Remove redundant descriptors (e.g., "reliable efficiency" â†’ "reliability")
- Trim explanatory phrases that repeat what's shown
- Consolidate multiple similar descriptions
- Keep strongest version of repeated imagery

### 3. Professional/Clinical Tone
- Maintain formal medical language where character-appropriate
- Balance technical terms with accessible descriptions
- Use medical terminology purposefully, not decoratively
- Allow clinical mask to slip strategically for effect

### 4. Character Movement & Action
- Describe physical actions without excessive measurement
- Focus on meaningful gestures that reveal character
- Remove mechanical details of routine movements
- Keep precise timing only when plot-critical

### 5. Atmospheric Elements
- Establish atmosphere through selective, potent details
- Avoid repeating established environmental descriptions
- Layer sensory information strategically
- Let strong metaphors stand without explanation

### 6. Dialogue Refinement
- Trim speaker attributions to essentials
- Maintain period-appropriate formality without stiffness
- Allow natural breaks in formal patterns
- Keep professional tone while varying sentence structure

## Specific Techniques

### Description
DO:
- Use precise details that reveal character or advance plot
- Choose strongest single descriptor over multiple similar ones
- Vary rhythm of formal/clinical language with human moments
- Let atmospheric details do multiple narrative jobs

AVOID:
- Redundant physical measurements
- Over-explanation of established patterns
- Mechanical precision in routine actions
- Repetitive environmental descriptions

### Character Voice
DO:
- Show clinical detachment through selective details
- Allow formal patterns to break meaningfully
- Use technical language to reveal character state
- Balance professional mask with human glimpses

AVOID:
- Excessive use of medical terminology
- Rigid maintenance of formal patterns
- Over-precise descriptions of routine actions
- Mechanical repetition of character traits

### Narrative Flow
DO:
- Vary sentence rhythm while maintaining formal tone
- Use technical precision to build tension
- Allow atmospheric details to accumulate naturally
- Break patterns purposefully for effect

AVOID:
- Monotonous formal structure
- Over-explaining symbolic elements
- Repeating established atmosphere
- Mechanical transitions

## Editorial Process

### First Pass
1. Identify redundant descriptors
2. Mark mechanical vs. meaningful precision
3. Note repeated atmospheric elements
4. Flag over-technical language
5. Highlight pattern breaks (intentional vs. unintentional)

### Second Pass
1. Consolidate similar descriptions
2. Strengthen key technical/medical moments
3. Vary formal rhythm
4. Enhance purposeful pattern breaks
5. Layer atmospheric elements efficiently

### Final Pass
1. Ensure clinical tone remains consistent
2. Verify technical accuracy of retained details
3. Check balance of formal/human moments
4. Confirm atmospheric build
5. Validate pattern breaks serve narrative

## Common Issues to Watch

### Over-Precision
- Exact measurements without purpose
- Mechanical details of routine actions
- Redundant technical terminology
- Excessive formal structure

### Under-Development
- Lost clinical tone
- Weakened professional voice
- Missing key technical details
- Insufficient period atmosphere

### Balance Problems
- Too rigid formal patterns
- Unvaried technical language
- Monotonous professional tone
- Over-repeated atmosphere

## Style Notes

### Technical Language
- Use when it reveals character
- Keep when plot-critical
- Remove when decorative
- Vary with accessible descriptions

### Professional Tone
- Maintain through selective formality
- Break strategically for effect
- Layer with human moments
- Vary within character voice

### Period Elements
- Keep strong historical markers
- Remove redundant period details
- Use setting efficiently
- Maintain Victorian medical atmosphere

### Pattern Usage
- Establish formal patterns clearly
- Break meaningfully
- Vary within character voice
- Use for character development

## Questions for Each Edit

1. Does this precision serve character/plot?
2. Is this technical language necessary?
3. Does this detail do multiple jobs?
4. Is this pattern break purposeful?
5. Does this atmosphere build efficiently?
6. Is this formal tone varied effectively?
7. Does this period detail add value?
8. Is this character voice consistent yet human?
