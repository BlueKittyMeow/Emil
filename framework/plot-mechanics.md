# The Specimen - Complete Plot Mechanics Walkthrough

## Phase 1: Discovery and Initial Investigation (0-50k words)

### Felix's Architectural Discovery
**Trigger**: Felix conducting property survey for architectural preservation project
**Documents Found**: 
- Property deeds showing Reichmann's ownership of multiple properties
- Correspondence between Reichmann and mysterious "H.S." (Heinrich Schumann)
- References to "specimens" and "collection maintenance"
- Financial records showing large payments to families

**Investigation Process**:
1. Felix recognizes medical terminology in correspondence
2. Consults Emil for professional interpretation
3. Research into Reichmann's background reveals Medical History professorship
4. Discovery of "Historical Medical Preservation Society" (front organization)

### Initial Collection Discovery
**Location**: Reichmann's townhouse near university
**Access Method**: Felix's legitimate architectural survey permissions
**Contents Found**:
- Standard historical medical specimens (skulls, preserved organs)
- Documentation of trades with other collectors
- Correspondence revealing three-party network: Reichmann, Schumann, unknown third party
- Quality suggests recent acquisitions, not just historical

**Emil's Analysis**:
- Recognizes some specimens as recently preserved (modern techniques)
- Identifies preservation methods requiring current medical knowledge
- Notes documentation style consistent with active research

## Phase 2: Pattern Recognition and Escalation (50-75k words)

### Disappearances Investigation
**Initial Clues**:
- Emil's colleagues mention patients failing to return for appointments
- Municipal records show gaps in death certificates for poor populations
- Pattern: vulnerable people with interesting medical conditions

**Pattern Analysis**:
- Disappearances cluster around certain time periods
- All subjects had consulted "traveling medical specialist"
- Families received unexpected financial compensation after disappearances
- Death certificates issued by unknown clinic

### Schumann Discovery and Interrogation
**Location Method**: Correspondence address traced through property records
**Initial Contact**: Emil and Felix approach as medical historians
**Information Extracted**:
- Confirms three-party collection network
- Reveals Reichmann's recent death and transfer of "darker elements"
- Describes Protégé as young, brilliant, and terrifying
- Admits to ongoing intimidation and fear
- Refuses to provide identifying information about Protégé

**Schumann's Limitations**:
- Only communicated with Reichmann, never directly with Protégé
- Genuinely doesn't know Protégé's identity
- Too terrified to involve authorities
- Provides historical context but no current actionable intelligence

## Phase 3: Protégé Identification Process (75-150k words)

### Research Methodology
**Academic Investigation**:
- Review of recent medical graduates specializing in psychiatry
- Analysis of published papers on consciousness and rare conditions
- Conference attendance records and lecture circuits
- Cross-reference with geographic access to Prague

**Pattern Matching**:
- Young psychiatrist with Vienna training
- Published work on patient observation and consciousness
- Known to Emil professionally (attended lectures, conferences)
- Currently operating clinic serving poor populations

### The Threatening Letters Campaign
**Escalation Trigger**: Protégé realizes he's being investigated
**Letter Content Progression**:
1. General observations about Emil's "interesting condition"
2. Specific details about Emil's routines and habits
3. References to "specimen value" and "documentation quality"
4. Direct threats: "Shall I have two such specimens for my collection?"

**Intelligence Gathering from Letters**:
- Handwriting analysis suggests medical training
- Paper quality indicates institutional access
- Knowledge of Emil's work suggests professional connection
- Timing correlates with investigation progress

### Identification Breakthrough
**Method**: Cross-referencing suspicious doctors with Emil's professional network
**Key Evidence**:
- Medical conference attendance overlapping with Emil's lectures
- Recent establishment of clinic near poorhouse district
- Publication history showing evolution from legitimate research to concerning theories
- Physical description matching witness accounts (always wears dark glasses)

**The Dark Glasses Connection**:
- Witnesses describe doctor who always wears tinted spectacles
- Claims photophobia from "research-related eye strain"
- Colleagues note he never removes them, even indoors
- Realization: hiding facial scarring/disfigurement

## Phase 4: The Sanatorium Trap (125-150k words)

### Trap Design and Planning
**Strategic Requirements**:
- Draw Protégé out of hiding after he fled initial identification
- Create irresistible target (deteriorated Emil in vulnerable setting)
- Maintain plausible cover story
- Position allies for intervention without alerting Protégé

**Emil's Confession to Weber**:
- Forced revelation of eating disorder to department chair
- Professional and personal risk assessment
- Weber's shock, concern, and ultimate agreement to help
- Establishment of legitimate medical intervention cover story

### Sanatorium Selection and Setup
**Location Criteria**:
- Private facility near Protégé's clinic territory
- Weber's professional connections for staff placement
- Isolation sufficient for Protégé's approach
- Accessibility for rescue team positioning

**Staff Infiltration**:
- Weber places 2-3 trusted associates in sanatorium
- Insufficient numbers to scare off Protégé
- Enough presence to provide intelligence and limited protection
- Careful balance between security and maintaining believable setup

### Execution Phase
**Emil's Staged Collapse**:
- Public breakdown during university lecture
- Weber's witnessed concern and medical intervention
- Transfer to private sanatorium for "nervous exhaustion"
- Emil's genuine deterioration from stress complicates performance

**Protégé's Response**:
- Takes bait but becomes suspicious of setup
- Approaches sanatorium for reconnaissance
- Plans acquisition but maintains caution
- Begins surveillance and preparation phase
