## Plot Points to Develop

### Homosexual attraction to Felix

Parallels to "medical curiosities" - Emil might encounter medical literature or specimens related to "sexual inversion" (the period term), creating moments of self-recognition while highlighting how the medical gaze objectified all forms of human difference.

Period-appropriate coding - Using the language of "particular friendship" or "intimate companionship" that was common in period literature to denote same-sex attraction without explicit statement.

Medical self-observation - Emil could note his physical responses to Felix's presence in his clinical self-documentation, creating a poignant intersection of his medical and personal identities.

Architectural metaphors - Felix's discussions of preserving spaces that others would demolish could create resonant parallels to Emil preserving aspects of himself that society would erase.
