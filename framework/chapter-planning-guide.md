# Novel Architecture Planning


## Chapter Planning Guidelines

### Scene Efficiency Requirements
Every scene must serve at least two of:
- Character development
- Plot advancement
- World-building
- Relationship dynamics
- Thematic reinforcement
- Pattern establishment/breaking
- Historical/social context
- Multiple character interactions


### Character Integration
- Introduce key characters naturally among others
- Show relationships through action
- Develop dynamics through interaction
- Reveal traits through observation

### Pattern Tracking (Emil's Gradual Relapse)
- Show established rules
- Note violations
- Track accumulating pressure
- Observe consequences
- Mark deterioration

### Plot Threading
- Weave collection mystery gradually
- Develop relationships organically
- Build tension through pattern disruption
- Layer social/professional complications
- Maintain multiple narrative lines

### World Building
- Include historical details naturally
- Show social/cultural context
- Demonstrate professional environment
- Reveal class/status dynamics
- Establish multiple languages

### Thematic Development
- Medical ethics through practice
- Power dynamics in action
- Personal/professional conflict
- Trust/betrayal in moments
- Body as subject through observation
